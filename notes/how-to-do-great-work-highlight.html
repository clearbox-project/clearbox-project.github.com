<li>Four steps: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bvxtvvjnf893r5y3n9mp57">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bvzdve4w31jkb5rb7j6j4h">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bw4d0wr9g7mq7ns2nz8ef2">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>But a field should become <em>increasingly</em> interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn't, it's probably not for you. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bw6049gv24aa6qhb60qh0y">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>One sign that you're suited for some kind of work is when you like even the parts that other people find tedious or frightening. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bw72fkfn8530yhyk9v3bje">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Write the story you want to read; build the tool you want to use. Since your friends probably have similar interests, this will also get you your initial audience. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bw7ws4bvwh5qty7cbz6qmj">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>This <em>should</em> follow from the excitingness rule. Obviously the most exciting story to write will be the one you want to read. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bw8yz2snn3860rh7bnbkzm">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>if you stick to what you find genuinely interesting, you'll be proof against all of them. If you're interested, you're not astray. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4bwbsb94ec19q2qkcd2z318">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li><p>That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h4c8a9zdswgk82d4b69tg373">View Highlight</a>)</p>

<li><p>I think for most people who want to do great work, the right strategy is not to plan too much. At each stage do whatever seems most interesting and gives you the best options for the future. I call this approach "staying upwind." This is how most people who've done great work seem to have done it.
