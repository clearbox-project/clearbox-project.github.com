<ul>
<li>“Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavor easier, they make it possible … no matter how internal processes are implemented [...you..] need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” (Levy 2011, 270) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=53">Location 53</a>)</li>
<li>“One cannot think without writing.” (Luhmann 1992, 53) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=57">Location 57</a>)</li>
<li>We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=140">Location 140</a>)</li>
<li>Self-discipline or self-control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=172">Location 172</a>)</li>
<li>Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=212">Location 212</a>)</li>
<li>the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=295">Location 295</a>)</li>
<li>Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=302">Location 302</a>)</li>
<li>Niklas Luhmann. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=308">Location 308</a>)

<li>And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=374">Location 374</a>)</li>
<li>Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned – which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=377">Location 377</a>)</li>
<li>Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=381">Location 381</a>)</li>

<li>Note: The intro to the slip-box</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=419">Location 419</a>)</li>
<li>in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=427">Location 427</a>)</li>
<li>He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=431">Location 431</a>)</li>
<li>The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=435">Location 435</a>)</li>
<li>By adding these links between notes, Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=446">Location 446</a>)</li>
<li>Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=494">Location 494</a>)</li>
<li>“Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,” neuroscientist Neil Levy concludes in the introduction to the Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics, summarizing decades of research. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=498">Location 498</a>)</li>
<li>as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=501">Location 501</a>)</li>
<li>And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=504">Location 504</a>)</li>
<li>Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=505">Location 505</a>)</li>
<li>Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=578">Location 578</a>)</li>
<li>Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=612">Location 612</a>)</li>
<li>They only function as a reminder of a thought and are not meant to capture the thought itself, which requires time to phrase proper sentences and check facts. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=631">Location 631</a>)</li>
<li>as Wilhelm von Humboldt, founder of the Humboldt University of Berlin and brother to the great explorer Alexander von Humboldt, put it, the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter. Everything within the university aims at some kind of publication. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=709">Location 709</a>)</li>
<li>It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing. The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=715">Location 715</a>)</li>
<li>The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=716">Location 716</a>)</li>
<li>And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=736">Location 736</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: The law of triviality, fs blog. About clear purpose</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We tend to think that big transformations have to start with an equally big idea. But more often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful (and often overlooked in the beginning). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=744">Location 744</a>)</li>
<li>When the advantages became obvious, second-order effects came into play and went into a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. The more harbours were able to handle containers, the more container ships were needed to be built, which made shipping cheaper, which increased the range of goods worth shipping, which created more traffic, which made bigger container ships economical, which created more demand for infrastructure and so on. It wasn’t just another way of shipping goods. It was a whole new way of doing business. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=774">Location 774</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Singularity</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=787">Location 787</a>)</li>
<li>The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=794">Location 794</a>)</li>
<li>The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=797">Location 797</a>)</li>
<li>Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=844">Location 844</a>)</li>
<li>Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=848">Location 848</a>)</li>
<li>Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=903">Location 903</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Reminds me hackathons</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We have to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper and build up an ever-growing pool of externalised thoughts. We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas – and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=929">Location 929</a>)</li>
<li>By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=933">Location 933</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Reminds me Ray Dalio on take notes on decision making then program it. And Munger on making decision journal. They are all sort of external thinking</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The things you are supposed to find in your head by brainstorming usually don’t have their origins in there. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=947">Location 947</a>)</li>
<li>a clear, reliable structure is paramount. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=981">Location 981</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Like GTD, a reliable workflow is the key</li>
</ul></li>
<li>exergonic and an endergonic reaction. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=986">Location 986</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: 可以结合集装箱的故事再仔细想想,是否存在临界点和催化剂。</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=991">Location 991</a>)</li>
<li>Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1008">Location 1008</a>)</li>
<li>To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1011">Location 1011</a>)</li>
<li>Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1014">Location 1014</a>)</li>
<li>Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1016">Location 1016</a>)</li>
<li>According to a widely cited study, the constant interruption of emails and text messages cuts our productivity by about 40% and makes us at least 10 IQ points dumber. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1073">Location 1073</a>)</li>
<li>mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1107">Location 1107</a>)</li>
<li>We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1108">Location 1108</a>)</li>
<li>it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them. “Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1180">Location 1180</a>)</li>
<li>The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” (Dean, 2013, 152) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1186">Location 1186</a>)</li>
<li>The mental flexibility to be extremely focused for one moment and playfully explore ideas in the next is just one side of the equation. To be flexible, we need an equally flexible work structure that doesn’t break down every time we depart from a preconceived plan. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1188">Location 1188</a>)

<li>“(An) exclusive use of analytical rationality tends to impede further improvement in human performance because of analytical rationality’s slow reasoning and its emphasis on rules, principles, and universal solutions. Second, bodily involvement, speed, and an intimate knowledge of concrete cases in the form of good examples is a prerequisite for true expertise.” (Flyvbjerg 2001, 15) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1199">Location 1199</a>)</li>

<li>As you might expect, the experienced paramedics were able to spot their kind correctly in almost all cases (~90%), while the beginners were more or less just guessing (~50%). So far, so good. But when the teachers watched the videos, they systematically mistook the beginners for experts and the experts for beginners. They were wrong in most of the cases (and only right in about a third of all the cases). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1227">Location 1227</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Teacher bias</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1231">Location 1231</a>)</li>
<li>gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience. It is the sedimentation of deeply learned practice through numerous feedback loops on success or failure. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1243">Location 1243</a>)</li>
<li>How does this fact fit into my idea of …? How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory? Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other? Isn’t this argument similar to that one? Haven’t I heard this before? And above all: What does x mean for y? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1284">Location 1284</a>)</li>
<li>Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory – until they are done. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1297">Location 1297</a>)</li>
<li>The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1300">Location 1300</a>)</li>
<li>Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1318">Location 1318</a>)</li>
<li>Acts of self-control, responsible decision making, and active choice seem to interfere with other such acts that follow soon after. The implication is that some vital resource of the self becomes depleted by such acts of volition. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1340">Location 1340</a>)</li>
<li>Even something seemingly unrelated like being the victim of prejudices can have a significant effect (Inzlicht, McKay, and Aronson, 2006) as “controlling the influence of stereotypes (… may rely on the same…) limited-strength resource on which people draw for self-regulation” (Govorun and Payne 2006, 112). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1344">Location 1344</a>)</li>
<li>It is well known that decision-making is one of the most tiring and wearying tasks, which is why people like Barack Obama or Bill Gates only wear two suit colours: dark blue or dark grey.

<li>Breaks are much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial for learning. They allow the brain to process information, move it into long-term memory and prepare it for new information (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013, 69). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1363">Location 1363</a>)</li>
<li>“I always have a slip of paper at hand, on which I note down the ideas of certain pages. On the backside I write down the bibliographic details. After finishing the book I go through my notes and think how these notes might be relevant for already written notes in the slip-box. It means that I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 150) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1404">Location 1404</a>)</li>

<li>But don’t turn it into a project in itself. Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1432">Location 1432</a>)</li>
<li>Different independent studies indicate that writing by hand facilitates understanding. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1435">Location 1435</a>)</li>
<li>students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1441">Location 1441</a>)</li>
<li>While we should seek out dis-confirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking, we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1457">Location 1457</a>)</li>

<li>The experience of how one piece of information can change the whole perspective on a certain problem is exciting. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1512">Location 1512</a>)</li>
<li>with the learned ability of spotting patterns, we can enter the circle of virtuosity: Reading becomes easier, we grasp the gist quicker, can read more in less time, and can more easily spot patterns and improve our understanding of them.

<li>Immanuel Kant described in his famous text about the Enlightenment: “Nonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” (Kant 1784) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1539">Location 1539</a>)</li>
<li>Rewriting what was already written almost automatically trains one to shift the attention towards frames, patterns and categories in the observations, or the conditions/assumptions, which enable certain, but not other descriptions.

<li>Reading with a pen in your hand is the small-scale equivalent of a lecture. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1571">Location 1571</a>)</li>
<li>The only difference is that the audience here consists of our future selves, which will very soon have reached the same state of ignorance as someone who never had access to what we have written about. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1573">Location 1573</a>)</li>
<li>“The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool,” Feynman stressed in a speech to young scientists (Feynman 1985, 342). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1581">Location 1581</a>)</li>
<li>Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. On top of that, we also tend to like it more (Bornstein 1989). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1583">Location 1583</a>)</li>
<li>We have to choose between feeling smarter or becoming smarter. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1591">Location 1591</a>)</li>
<li>The mere-exposure effect would fool us here, too: Seeing something we have seen before causes the same emotional reaction as if we had been able to retrieve the information from our memory. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1597">Location 1597</a>)</li>
<li>please look up the statistics: The majority of students chooses every day not to test themselves in any way. Instead, they apply the very method research has shown again (Karpicke, Butler, and Roediger 2009) and again (Brown 2014, ch. 1) to be almost completely useless: rereading and underlining sentences for later rereading. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1602">Location 1602</a>)</li>
<li>Consciously, we probably would all choose the same, but what really matters are the many small, implicit choices we have to make every day, and they are most often made unconsciously. This is why choosing an external system that forces us to deliberate practice and confronts us as much as possible with our lack of understanding or not-yet-learned information is such a smart move. We only have to make the conscious choice once. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1605">Location 1605</a>)</li>
<li>“The one who does the work does the learning,” writes Doyle (2008, 63). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1616">Location 1616</a>)</li>
<li>When we try to answer a question before we know how to, we will later remember the answer better, even if our attempt failed (Arnold and McDermott 2013). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1633">Location 1633</a>)</li>
<li>“If learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act” (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013).[29] (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1641">Location 1641</a>)</li>
<li>exercise helps to transfer information into long-term memory (cf. Ratey 2008). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1644">Location 1644</a>)</li>
<li>The slip-box takes care of storing facts and information. Thinking and understanding is what it can’t take off your shoulders, which is why it makes sense to focus on this part of the work. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1654">Location 1654</a>)</li>
<li>The objection that it takes too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box is therefore short-sighted. Writing, taking notes and thinking about how ideas connect is exactly the kind of elaboration that is needed to learn. Not learning from what we read because we don’t take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of time. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1660">Location 1660</a>)</li>
<li>The ability to think beyond the given frames of a text (Lonka 2003, 155f). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1672">Location 1672</a>)</li>
<li>scientific thinking is plainly impossible if we can’t manage to think beyond a given context and we only focus on the information as it is given to us (Bruner, 1973, quoted after ibid.) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1681">Location 1681</a>)</li>
<li>The brain, as Kahneman writes, is “a machine for jumping to conclusions” (Kahneman, 2013, 79). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1748">Location 1748</a>)</li>
<li>One note states the relevance of the book for my own thinking and one explains my idea in more detail. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1791">Location 1791</a>)</li>
<li>Just by writing down these questions and making possible connections explicit in writing are the concepts and theories being investigated. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1805">Location 1805</a>)</li>
<li>Transferring these ideas into the network of our own thoughts, our latticework of theories, concepts and mental models in the slip-box brings our thinking to the next level. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1815">Location 1815</a>)</li>
<li>Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1820">Location 1820</a>)</li>
<li>It wasn’t just that Shereshevsky was able to remember so much, he had trouble forgetting anything. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1835">Location 1835</a>)</li>
<li>Although he was very good at remembering facts, Shereshevsky was almost incapable of getting the gist of something, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1837">Location 1837</a>)</li>
<li>Psychologists call this mechanism active inhibition (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1848">Location 1848</a>)</li>
<li>Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1867">Location 1867</a>)</li>

<li>Hermann Ebbinghaus, the godfather of learning theory, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1891">Location 1891</a>)</li>
<li>But he didn’t realise that he was stripping the learning process from the very thing that is learning, which is making meaningful connections. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1893">Location 1893</a>)</li>
<li>Ebbinghaus laid the foundation for a long-lasting and influential tradition of learning theories that separates understanding from learning. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1896">Location 1896</a>)</li>
<li>The challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much to learn, but to understand, as we will already have learned what we understand. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1911">Location 1911</a>)</li>
<li>elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1913">Location 1913</a>)</li>
<li>Learned right, which means understanding, which means connecting in a meaningful way to previous knowledge, information almost cannot be forgotten anymore and will be reliably retrieved if triggered by the right cues. Moreover, this new learned knowledge can provide more possible connections for new information. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1928">Location 1928</a>)</li>
<li>The slip-box is forcing us to do the exact opposite: To elaborate, to understand, to connect and therefore to learn seriously. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=1943">Location 1943</a>)</li>
<li>as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2004">Location 2004</a>)</li>
<li>all we need from the index are entry points. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2011">Location 2011</a>)</li>
<li>“Tversky/Kahneman (1973) showed in an experiment that people are more likely to overestimate the likelihood of an event to happen if they are able to conceive it well and in detail than if it were abstract.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2025">Location 2025</a>)</li>
<li>Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2046">Location 2046</a>)</li>
<li>If you use the slip-box for a while, you will inevitably make a sobering discovery: The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn’t even yours, but someone else’s. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2111">Location 2111</a>)

<li>The brain is very good at making associations and spotting patterns and similarities between seemingly different things and also very good in spotting differences between seemingly similar things, but it needs to have them presented objectively and externally. It is much easier to see differences and similarities than to detect them by mere thinking. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2123">Location 2123</a>)</li>
<li>Albert Rothenberg suggests that the construction of oppositions is the most reliable way of generating new ideas (Rothenberg 1971; 1996; 2015). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2130">Location 2130</a>)</li>

<li>The importance is to have not just a few, but a broad range of mental models in your head. Otherwise, you risk becoming too attached to one or two and see only what fits them. You would become the man with a hammer who sees nails everywhere (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2167">Location 2167</a>)</li>
<li>you’ve got to array your experience, both vicarious and direct, on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered. Well, they fail in school and in life. You’ve got to hang experience on a latticework of models in your head.” (Munger 1994). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2171">Location 2171</a>)</li>
<li>It is much better to learn from the experiences of others – especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile “mental models” that can be used in different situations. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2176">Location 2176</a>)</li>
<li>you would much rather be in a virtuous learning circle, so to remember what you have learned, you need to build effective long-term memory structures.” (Sachs 2013, 26) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2193">Location 2193</a>)</li>
<li>We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2202">Location 2202</a>)</li>
<li>“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something.” (Steve Jobs) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2211">Location 2211</a>)</li>
<li>intuition is not the opposition to rationality and knowledge, it is rather the incorporated, practical side of our intellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build our conscious, explicit knowledge (cf. Ahrens 2014). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2230">Location 2230</a>)</li>
<li>The brain is more likely to notice details when it scans than when it focuses.” (Zull 2002, 142f) This is one of the reasons why thinking works so much better when we have the very things we think about in front of our eyes. It is in our nature. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2247">Location 2247</a>)</li>
<li>“[C]reative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections and seeing things in an original way—seeing things that others cannot see“ (Andreasen 2014).

<li>The better an engineer is at abstracting from a specific problem, the better and more pragmatic his solutions will be – even for the very problem he abstracted from (Gassmann and Zeschky, 2008, 103). Abstraction is also the key to analyse and compare concepts, to make analogies and to combine ideas; this is especially true when it comes to interdisciplinary work (Goldstone and Wilensky 2008).

<li>they emphasise the importance of feedback loops and the need to find ways to confront ourselves with our errors, mistakes and misunderstandings. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2289">Location 2289</a>)</li>
<li>Another habit of the effective thinkers they highlight is their ability to focus on the main ideas behind the details, to grasp the gist of something. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2291">Location 2291</a>)</li>
<li>Make sure that you really see what you think you see and describe it as plainly and factually as possible. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2294">Location 2294</a>)</li>

<li>One possibility to deal with this tendency is to ask counterfactual questions, like “what if?” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2332">Location 2332</a>)</li>
<li>Sometimes, it is more important to rediscover the problems for which we already have a solution than to think solely about the problems that are present to us. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2334">Location 2334</a>)</li>
<li>The first question should always be directed towards the question itself: What kind of answer can you expect from asking a question in this particular way? What is missing? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2337">Location 2337</a>)</li>

<li>the worst thing you can do is to make a simple task unnecessarily complicated. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2347">Location 2347</a>)</li>
<li>Sometimes the breakthrough in a scientific process is the discovery of a simple principle behind a seemingly very complicated process. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2355">Location 2355</a>)</li>
<li>We check if what we understood from a text is really in the text by having our understanding in written form in front of our eyes. We learn to focus on the gist of an idea by restricting ourselves in terms of space. We can make it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort our notes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2361">Location 2361</a>)</li>
<li>In his book “The Paradox of Choice,” Barry Schwartz used numerous examples, from shopping to career options to romance, to show that less choice can not only increase our productivity, but also our freedom and make it easier to be in the moment and enjoy it (Schwartz, 2007). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2383">Location 2383</a>)</li>
<li>“Remember the lesson: ‘An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.’” (Charles T. Munger) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2430">Location 2430</a>)</li>
<li>A visibly developed cluster attracts more ideas and provides more possible connections, which in return influence our choices on what to read and think further. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2462">Location 2462</a>)</li>
<li>This is how evolution works: by trial and error, not planning. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2477">Location 2477</a>)</li>
<li>We have to work, write, connect, differentiate, complement and elaborate on questions – but this is what we do when we take smart notes. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2480">Location 2480</a>)</li>
<li>Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new.

<li>while the belief in our own ingenuity decreases with expertise, we become more able to actually make a genuine new contribution. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WVYW33Y&amp;location=2492">Location 2492</a>)</li>
<li>When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan, 2006; Reeve, 2009).

<li>The beginning of the research project that led to the discovery of DNA’s structure was the application for a grant. The grant was not to discover DNA’s structure, but find a treatment for cancer.
