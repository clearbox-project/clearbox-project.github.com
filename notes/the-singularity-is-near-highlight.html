<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>To my mother, Hannah, who provided me with the courage to seek the ideas to confront any challenge (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=65">Location 65</a>)</li>
<li>I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success. —NIKOLA TESLA, 1896, INVENTOR OF ALTERNATING CURRENT (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=242">Location 242</a>)</li>
<li>The theme was “many paths to the truth.” I noticed, of course, many parallels among the world’s religious traditions, but even the inconsistencies were illuminating. It became clear to me that the basic truths were profound enough to transcend apparent contradictions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=252">Location 252</a>)</li>
<li>The moral of these tales was simple: the right idea had the power to overcome a seemingly overwhelming challenge. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=259">Location 259</a>)</li>
<li>To this day, I remain convinced of this basic philosophy: no matter what quandaries we face—business problems, health issues, relationship difficulties, as well as the great scientific, social, and cultural challenges of our time—there is an idea that can enable us to prevail. Furthermore, we can find that idea. And when we find it, we need to implement it. My life has been shaped by this imperative. The power of an idea—this is itself an idea. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=260">Location 260</a>)</li>
<li>Inventing is a lot like surfing: you have to anticipate and catch the wave at just the right moment. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=286">Location 286</a>)</li>
<li>Over the last twenty years, I have come to appreciate an important meta-idea: that the power of ideas to transform the world is itself accelerating. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=293">Location 293</a>)</li>
<li>I discovered that unlike mere tricks, technology does not lose its transcendent power when its secrets are revealed. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=316">Location 316</a>)</li>
<li>Our incantations are the formulas and algorithms underlying our modern-day magic. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=326">Location 326</a>)</li>
<li>Muriel Rukeyser says that “the universe is made of stories, not of atoms.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=335">Location 335</a>)</li>
<li>Everyone takes the limits of his own vision for the limits of the world. —ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=341">Location 341</a>)</li>
<li>What, then, is the Singularity? It’s a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=348">Location 348</a>)</li>
<li>the law of accelerating returns (the inherent acceleration of the rate of evolution, with technological evolution as a continuation of biological evolution). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=354">Location 354</a>)</li>
<li>law of accelerating returns (the inherent acceleration of the rate of evolution, with technological evolution as a continuation of biological evolution). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=354">Location 354</a>)</li>
<li>Exponential growth is deceptive. It starts out almost imperceptibly and then explodes with unexpected fury—unexpected, that is, if one does not take care to follow its trajectory. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=358">Location 358</a>)</li>
<li>This book will argue, however, that within several decades information-based technologies will encompass all human knowledge and proficiency, ultimately including the pattern-recognition powers, problem-solving skills, and emotional and moral intelligence of the human brain itself. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=373">Location 373</a>)</li>
<li>We use its massive parallelism (one hundred trillion interneuronal connections operating simultaneously) to quickly recognize subtle patterns. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=376">Location 376</a>)</li>
<li>our thinking is extremely slow: the basic neural transactions are several million times slower than contemporary electronic circuits. That makes our physiological bandwidth for processing new information extremely limited compared to the exponential growth of the overall human knowledge base. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=377">Location 377</a>)</li>
<li>By the end of this century, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will be trillions of trillions of times more powerful than unaided human intelligence. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=383">Location 383</a>)</li>
<li>From a strictly mathematical perspective, the growth rates will still be finite but so extreme that the changes they bring about will appear to rupture the fabric of human history. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=389">Location 389</a>)</li>
<li>There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality. If you wonder what will remain unequivocally human in such a world, it’s simply this quality: ours is the species that inherently seeks to extend its physical and mental reach beyond current limitations. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=392">Location 392</a>)</li>
<li>The Intuitive Linear View Versus the Historical Exponential View (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=398">Location 398</a>)</li>
<li>When the first transhuman intelligence is created and launches itself into recursive self-improvement, a fundamental discontinuity is likely to occur, the likes of which I can’t even begin to predict. —MICHAEL ANISSIMOV (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=399">Location 399</a>)</li>
<li>few observers have truly internalized the implications of the fact that the rate of change itself is accelerating. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=413">Location 413</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: In fact, I think, there’s no such thing as knee point, coz every point can be considered as knee point in the exponential graph. What matters is the scale.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“intuitive linear” view of history rather than the “historical exponential” view. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=415">Location 415</a>)</li>
<li>To express this another way, we won’t experience one hundred years of technological advance in the twenty-first century; we will witness on the order of twenty thousand years of progress (again, when measured by today’s rate of progress), or about one thousand times greater than what was achieved in the twentieth century. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=419">Location 419</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Do we feel this way tho?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Exponential growth is a feature of any evolutionary process, of which technology is a primary example. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=445">Location 445</a>)</li>
<li>we often find not just simple exponential growth, but “double” exponential growth, meaning that the rate of exponential growth (that is, the exponent) is itself growing exponentially (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=447">Location 447</a>)</li>
<li>This may have been a satisfactory approach when a generation of science and technology lasted longer than a human generation, but it does not serve society’s interests now that a generation of scientific and technological progress comprises only a few years. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=454">Location 454</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: interesting point</li>
</ul></li>
<li>That’s why people tend to overestimate what can be achieved in the short term (because we tend to leave out necessary details) but underestimate what can be achieved in the long term (because exponential growth is ignored). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=476">Location 476</a>)</li>
<li>First we build the tools, then they build us. —MARSHALL MCLUHAN (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=478">Location 478</a>)</li>
<li>The future ain’t what it used to be. —YOGI BERRA (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=480">Location 480</a>)</li>
<li>Evolution is a process of creating patterns of increasing order. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=481">Location 481</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Reverse of entropy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>each stage or epoch uses the information-processing methods of the previous epoch to create the next. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=484">Location 484</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: This is why evolution is exponential</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It’s hard to imagine how we could test these theories of evolution applied to early cosmology, but it’s clear that the physical laws of our universe are precisely what they need to be to allow for the evolution of increasing levels of order and complexity (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=501">Location 501</a>)</li>
<li>opposable thumb, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=516">Location 516</a>)</li>
