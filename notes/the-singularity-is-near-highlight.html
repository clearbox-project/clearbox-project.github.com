<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>To my mother, Hannah, who provided me with the courage to seek the ideas to confront any challenge (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=65">Location 65</a>)</li>
<li>I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success. —NIKOLA TESLA, 1896, INVENTOR OF ALTERNATING CURRENT (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=242">Location 242</a>)</li>
<li>The theme was “many paths to the truth.” I noticed, of course, many parallels among the world’s religious traditions, but even the inconsistencies were illuminating. It became clear to me that the basic truths were profound enough to transcend apparent contradictions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=252">Location 252</a>)</li>
<li>The moral of these tales was simple: the right idea had the power to overcome a seemingly overwhelming challenge. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=259">Location 259</a>)</li>
<li>To this day, I remain convinced of this basic philosophy: no matter what quandaries we face—business problems, health issues, relationship difficulties, as well as the great scientific, social, and cultural challenges of our time—there is an idea that can enable us to prevail. Furthermore, we can find that idea. And when we find it, we need to implement it. My life has been shaped by this imperative. The power of an idea—this is itself an idea. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=260">Location 260</a>)</li>
<li>Inventing is a lot like surfing: you have to anticipate and catch the wave at just the right moment. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=286">Location 286</a>)</li>
<li>Over the last twenty years, I have come to appreciate an important meta-idea: that the power of ideas to transform the world is itself accelerating. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=293">Location 293</a>)</li>
<li>I discovered that unlike mere tricks, technology does not lose its transcendent power when its secrets are revealed. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=316">Location 316</a>)</li>
<li>Our incantations are the formulas and algorithms underlying our modern-day magic. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=326">Location 326</a>)</li>
<li>Muriel Rukeyser says that “the universe is made of stories, not of atoms.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=335">Location 335</a>)</li>
<li>Everyone takes the limits of his own vision for the limits of the world. —ARTHUR SCHOPENHAUER (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=341">Location 341</a>)</li>
<li>What, then, is the Singularity? It’s a future period during which the pace of technological change will be so rapid, its impact so deep, that human life will be irreversibly transformed. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=348">Location 348</a>)</li>
<li>the law of accelerating returns (the inherent acceleration of the rate of evolution, with technological evolution as a continuation of biological evolution). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=354">Location 354</a>)</li>
<li>law of accelerating returns (the inherent acceleration of the rate of evolution, with technological evolution as a continuation of biological evolution). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=354">Location 354</a>)</li>
<li>Exponential growth is deceptive. It starts out almost imperceptibly and then explodes with unexpected fury—unexpected, that is, if one does not take care to follow its trajectory. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=358">Location 358</a>)</li>
<li>This book will argue, however, that within several decades information-based technologies will encompass all human knowledge and proficiency, ultimately including the pattern-recognition powers, problem-solving skills, and emotional and moral intelligence of the human brain itself. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=373">Location 373</a>)</li>
<li>We use its massive parallelism (one hundred trillion interneuronal connections operating simultaneously) to quickly recognize subtle patterns. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=376">Location 376</a>)</li>
<li>our thinking is extremely slow: the basic neural transactions are several million times slower than contemporary electronic circuits. That makes our physiological bandwidth for processing new information extremely limited compared to the exponential growth of the overall human knowledge base. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=377">Location 377</a>)</li>
<li>By the end of this century, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will be trillions of trillions of times more powerful than unaided human intelligence. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=383">Location 383</a>)</li>
<li>From a strictly mathematical perspective, the growth rates will still be finite but so extreme that the changes they bring about will appear to rupture the fabric of human history. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=389">Location 389</a>)</li>
<li>There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality. If you wonder what will remain unequivocally human in such a world, it’s simply this quality: ours is the species that inherently seeks to extend its physical and mental reach beyond current limitations. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=392">Location 392</a>)</li>
<li>The Intuitive Linear View Versus the Historical Exponential View (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=398">Location 398</a>)</li>
<li>When the first transhuman intelligence is created and launches itself into recursive self-improvement, a fundamental discontinuity is likely to occur, the likes of which I can’t even begin to predict. —MICHAEL ANISSIMOV (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=399">Location 399</a>)</li>
<li>few observers have truly internalized the implications of the fact that the rate of change itself is accelerating. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=413">Location 413</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: In fact, I think, there’s no such thing as knee point, coz every point can be considered as knee point in the exponential graph. What matters is the scale.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“intuitive linear” view of history rather than the “historical exponential” view. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=415">Location 415</a>)</li>
<li>To express this another way, we won’t experience one hundred years of technological advance in the twenty-first century; we will witness on the order of twenty thousand years of progress (again, when measured by today’s rate of progress), or about one thousand times greater than what was achieved in the twentieth century. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=419">Location 419</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Do we feel this way tho?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Exponential growth is a feature of any evolutionary process, of which technology is a primary example. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=445">Location 445</a>)</li>
<li>we often find not just simple exponential growth, but “double” exponential growth, meaning that the rate of exponential growth (that is, the exponent) is itself growing exponentially (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=447">Location 447</a>)</li>
<li>This may have been a satisfactory approach when a generation of science and technology lasted longer than a human generation, but it does not serve society’s interests now that a generation of scientific and technological progress comprises only a few years. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=454">Location 454</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: interesting point</li>
</ul></li>
<li>That’s why people tend to overestimate what can be achieved in the short term (because we tend to leave out necessary details) but underestimate what can be achieved in the long term (because exponential growth is ignored). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=476">Location 476</a>)</li>
<li>First we build the tools, then they build us. —MARSHALL MCLUHAN (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=478">Location 478</a>)</li>
<li>The future ain’t what it used to be. —YOGI BERRA (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=480">Location 480</a>)</li>
<li>Evolution is a process of creating patterns of increasing order. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=481">Location 481</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Reverse of entropy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>each stage or epoch uses the information-processing methods of the previous epoch to create the next. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=484">Location 484</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: This is why evolution is exponential</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It’s hard to imagine how we could test these theories of evolution applied to early cosmology, but it’s clear that the physical laws of our universe are precisely what they need to be to allow for the evolution of increasing levels of order and complexity (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=501">Location 501</a>)</li>

<li><p>Animals can adapt to problems and make inventions, but often no faster than natural selection can do its work—the world acts as its own simulator in the case of natural selection. We humans have the ability to internalize the world and conduct “what if’s” in our heads; we can solve many problems thousands of times faster than natural selection. Now, by creating the means to execute those simulations at much higher speeds, we are entering a regime as radically different from our human past as we humans are from the lower animals.

<li>VERNOR VINGE, “THE TECHNOLOGICAL SINGULARITY,” 1993 (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=581">Location 581</a>)</li>
<li>Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an “intelligence explosion,” and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make. —IRVING JOHN GOOD, “SPECULATIONS CONCERNING THE FIRST ULTRAINTELLIGENT MACHINE,” 1965 (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=583">Location 583</a>)</li>
<li>“Singularity” is an English word meaning a unique event with, well, singular implications. The word was adopted by mathematicians to denote a value that transcends any finite limitation, such as the explosion of magnitude that results when dividing a constant by a number that gets closer and closer to zero. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=590">Location 590</a>)</li>
<li>“evolutionary heirs,” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=617">Location 617</a>)</li>
<li>“MEST” (matter, energy, space, and time) compression. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=621">Location 621</a>)</li>
<li>one of the salient implications of the Singularity will be a change in the nature of our ability to understand. We will become vastly smarter as we merge with our technology. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=625">Location 625</a>)</li>
<li>Machines will process and switch signals at close to the speed of light (about three hundred million meters per second), compared to about one hundred meters per second for the electrochemical signals used in biological mammalian brains.31 This speed ratio is at least three million to one. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=663">Location 663</a>)</li>
<li><p>Multiple machines can do both at the same time: become one and separate simultaneously. Humans call this falling in love, but our biological ability to do this is fleeting and unreliable. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=668">Location 668</a>)</p>

<li><p>their intelligence is no longer of fixed capacity). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=631">Location 631</a>)</p></li>
<li>Once machines achieve the ability to design and engineer technology as humans do, only at far higher speeds and capacities, they will have access to their own designs (source code) and the ability to manipulate them. Humans are now accomplishing something similar through biotechnology (changing the genetic and other information processes underlying our biology), but in a much slower and far more limited way than what machines will be able to achieve by modifying their own programs. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=676">Location 676</a>)</li>
<li>without increased size or energy consumption. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=690">Location 690</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Why?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The further backward you look, the further forward you can see. —WINSTON CHURCHILL (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=859">Location 859</a>)</li>
<li>(Paradigm shifts are major changes in methods and intellectual processes to accomplish tasks; (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=877">Location 877</a>)</li>
<li>from the Big Bang to the Internet. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=879">Location 879</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: There’s a book called that. Check it out</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Some observers have judged that the truly epochal advances in the history of biology and technology have involved increases in complexity. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=882">Location 882</a>)</li>
<li>the “algorithmic information content” (AIC) of a set of information as “the length of the shortest program that will cause a standard universal computer to print out the string of bits and then halt.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=898">Location 898</a>)</li>
<li>“Increasing complexity” on its own is not, however, the ultimate goal or end-product of these evolutionary processes. Evolution results in better answers, not necessarily more complicated ones. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=927">Location 927</a>)</li>
<li>If we can predict future data from past data, that future data stops being information. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=933">Location 933</a>)</li>
<li>Order is information that fits a purpose. The measure of order is the measure of how well the information fits the purpose. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=936">Location 936</a>)</li>
<li>Simply having more information does not necessarily result in a better fit. Sometimes, a deeper order—a better fit to a purpose—is achieved through simplification rather than further increases in complexity. For example, a new theory that ties together apparently disparate ideas into one broader, more coherent theory reduces complexity but nonetheless may increase the “order for a purpose.” (In this case, the purpose is to accurately model observed phenomena.) Indeed, achieving simpler theories is a driving force in science. (As Einstein said, “Make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler.”) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=942">Location 942</a>)</li>
<li>Thus improving a solution to a problem—which usually increases but sometimes decreases complexity—increases order. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=952">Location 952</a>)</li>
<li>evolution increases order, which may or may not increase complexity (but usually does). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=963">Location 963</a>)</li>
<li>Innovation is multiplicative, not additive. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=971">Location 971</a>)</li>
<li>An evolutionary process is not a closed system; evolution draws upon the chaos in the larger system in which it takes place for its options for diversity. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=984">Location 984</a>)</li>
<li>this exponential growth in the power and price-performance of information-based technologies is not limited to computers but is true for essentially all information technologies and includes human knowledge, measured many different ways. It is also important to note that the term “information technology” is encompassing an increasingly broad class of phenomena and will ultimately include the full range of economic activity and cultural endeavor. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=990">Location 990</a>)</li>
<li>This latter surge will not reach an asymptote until we saturate the matter and energy in our region of the universe with computation, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1043">Location 1043</a>)</li>
<li>During this third or maturing phase in the life cycle of a paradigm, pressure begins to build for the next paradigm shift. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1045">Location 1045</a>)</li>
<li>Generally, by the time a paradigm approaches its asymptote in price-performance, the next technical paradigm is already working in niche applications. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1049">Location 1049</a>)</li>
<li>Each stage of evolution provides more powerful tools for the next. For example, in biological evolution, the advent of DNA enabled more powerful and faster evolutionary “experiments.” Or to take a more recent example, the advent of computer-assisted design tools allows rapid development of the next generation of computers. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1054">Location 1054</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: simulation in different layers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A probabilistic fractal adds the element of uncertainty. Whereas a deterministic fractal will look the same every time it is rendered, a probabilistic fractal will look different each time, although with similar characteristics. In a probabilistic fractal, the probability of each generator element being applied is less than 1. In this way, the resulting designs have a more organic appearance. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1070">Location 1070</a>)</li>
<li>The upcoming primary paradigm shift will be from biological thinking to a hybrid combining biological and nonbiological thinking (Epoch Five), which will include “biologically inspired” processes resulting from the reverse engineering of biological brains. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1086">Location 1086</a>)</li>
<li>This does not imply that biological (genetic) evolution is not continuing, just that it is no longer leading the pace in terms of improving order (or of the effectiveness and efficiency of computation). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1093">Location 1093</a>)</li>
<li>As discussed in the previous chapter, the overall rate of adopting new paradigms, which parallels the rate of technological progress, is currently doubling every decade. That is, the time to adopt new paradigms is going down by half each decade. At this rate, technological progress in the twenty-first century will be equivalent (in the linear view) to two hundred centuries of progress (at the rate of progress in 2000). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1109">Location 1109</a>)</li>
<li>A machine is as distinctively and brilliantly and expressively human as a violin sonata or a theorem in Euclid. —GREGORY VLASTOS (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1114">Location 1114</a>)</li>
<li>No communication technology has ever disappeared, but instead becomes increasingly less important as the technological horizon widens. —ARTHUR C. CLARKE (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B000QCSA7C&amp;location=1119">Location 1119</a>)</li>
