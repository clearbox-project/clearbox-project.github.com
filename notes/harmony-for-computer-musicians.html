<li>While rhythm provides the essential heartbeat and lifeblood of the musical language, it is melody that provides our music with a sense of meaning and emotional power of expression. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00B7RF9HE&amp;location=254">Location 254</a>)</li>
<li>Chords of only two notes are called dyads, while a chord of three notes is called a triad. Chords of four notes are called tetrads, while chords of five notes are called pentads. An extremely complex chord consisting of 10 different notes would thus be called a decad.

<li>Combinations of two notes that sound agreeable together give rise to intervals, which are described as being concords or consonances, while combinations of two notes that seem to clash or disagree with one another are described as being discords or dissonances.
