<li>In July and August of 2011 the team filmed in Gorongosa National Park in the southern African nation of Mozambique, bringing home feature material for four chapters in ecology. While shooting in the rain forest atop Gorongosa Mountain, we spent a little time collecting. The carpenter ant to the left, collected on our trip, is a species of the genus Camponotus that was previously unknown to science.<br />
Our goal is to have students see the living world the way a naturalist sees it. To “see,” for example, the chemical environment of organisms, such as the plumes of pheromone and territory-marking molecules that organisms use to communicate. Ants have been the study of a lifetime for Edward O. Wilson. We’ll bring some special lessons to students from the world of ants.</li>
