<li>Naval’s Foundational Values (a few examples)<br />
Key takeaways:
<ul>
<li>Values are a set of things that one chooses not to compromise on and lives by.</li>
<li>Examples of foundational values include honesty, long-term thinking, pure relationships, and no anger.</li>
<li>Finding relationships, co-workers, and partners with aligned values is important for harmony.</li>
<li>Incompatible values often lead to disagreements and conflicts over trivial matters.<br /><br />
Transcript:<br /><br />
Speaker 1<br /><br />
I would define values first of all as a set of things that you will not compromise on upon Um, so foundational values to me are things that I've looked at very very carefully about myself And I've deliberately chosen and said, you know what? This is a habit. This is a way of life And I'm not going to compromise on it. I'm going to stay this way forever Uh, I just don't want to live life any other way Um, now I've never fully enumerated them, but you know examples of them like I think honesty is a core core core value Um to be to give you examples of what I mean by honesty is I want to be able to just be me I don't want to I never want to be in an environment around people where I have to watch what I say Because if I disconnect what I'm thinking from what I'm saying that creates multiple threads in my mind Uh, that means that I'm no longer in the moment That means that I now have to work the future planning or past regretting every time i'm talking to somebody So, um, anyone around whom I can't be fully honest. I don't want to be around Um, uh, another example of a foundational value is Uh, I don't believe in any short-term thinking or dealing So if I see anybody who's even around me Uh, like let's say I'm doing business with somebody and they think in a short-term manner with somebody else Then I don't want to do business without person anymore Because I think all the benefits in life come from compound interest whether in money or in relationships or love or health or activities or habits So I only want to be around people that I know i'm going to be around with for the rest of my life Uh, and I only want to work on things that I know have the long-term Uh payout Another one is like I only believe in pure relationships. I don't believe in a hierarchical relationship So I don't want to be above anybody and I don't want to be below anybody If I can't treat someone like a peer and if they can't treat me like a peer then we have them I just don't want to interact with that human Um, another one is I don't believe in anger anymore I mean that was something that was good when I was young and full of testosterone But now I always like the Buddha saying that anger is a hot cold that she holds in her hand while waiting To throw it at somebody So, you know, I don't want to be angry and I don't want to be around angry people So I just cut them out of my life Um, and I'm not judging them I mean I I went through a lot of anger too And so, you know, they have to work through it on their own but go be angry at someone else somewhere else Um, so I don't know if that necessarily falls into the classical definition of value But it's a set of things that I won't compromise on Uh, and that I just lived my entire life by And I think everybody has values and a lot of finding great relationships, great co-workers, great lovers Uh, wives, husbands is finding other people where your values just line up And then the little things don't matter Generally I find that if people are fighting or quarreling about something, it's because their values don't line up Because their values lined up, the little thing wouldn't matter (<a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/ad7637b0-8248-4405-b06f-e49499e23fa2">Time 0:41:07</a>)</li>

<li><p>Individual Inner Work is a Single Player Game<br />
Key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Working on inner growth and self-improvement can be a lonely task.</li>
<li>Group activities and social affirmation may not contribute significantly to true internal work.</li>
<li>Individual effort is essential for personal transcendence and achieving enlightenment or happiness.<br />
Transcript:<br />
Speaker 1<br />
When you're when you're working on your inner stuff People don't love that It's not that they don't dislike it your friends of course support you, but they're not getting anything out of it Uh, and even when I look at my own Uh peer group and to the extent that they're working on themselves and and everyone in their 40s at some level is Most of them are engaged in group activities. Hey, let's do a group meditation. Hey, let's let's group event Hey, let's go to this group lecture and I keep coming back to this one line that I read like everything I just read but Um, which was said only the individual transcends Nobody reaches enlightenment or or or internal happiness or does serious internal work in group settings Uh, it is a very lonely kind of task Uh, so to some extent I think that people who are constantly looking for social affirmation In their internal work aren't that serious about it? What could and it's fine? I'm not judging But just they're craving More social interaction than they're really craving internal work (<a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/57e5b9de-bcb1-4da3-b6c2-d1fb90d5fa3a">Time 0:55:32</a>)<br />

<li><p>Reading beyond the norm<br />
Key takeaways:</p>

<ul>
<li>A willingness to read diverse, disagreeable, or even reprehensible content can expand one's perspective.</li>
<li>Reading what everyone else is reading limits one's ability to think independently and gain wisdom.</li>
<li>Many popular books are designed to conform to social approval and conditioning, hindering personal success or happiness.<br />
Transcript:<br />
Speaker 1<br />
I read all kinds of stuff that other people consider junk or even reprehensible I read all kinds of stuff that I disagree with because of mind bender. Yeah Um I found myself and some random dark hole in twitter the other day Where I was reading this guy's tweets and like wow he's really smart. That is really interesting I was very clever like wait a minute. This guy's a full blown white supremacist I mean he's not even like mildly a white supremacist He just thinks like everyone in the white race should be gone and people like me shouldn't be allowed on the streets But it was still fascinating and he's still really smart and I can't reading it And I read it and read it and read it and after a while I built up my own sense of his coherent view of the world and where he was coming from But to do that I couldn't have judged too much and I'm certainly not going to go around bragging to my friend Hey, I learned this from a white supremacist the other day Right, so to some level you almost have to read the stuff you're reading because you're into it And that's it if you don't need any other reason there's no<br />
Speaker 2<br />
There's no mission here to accomplish Yeah, if you read because you enjoy it if you read what everybody else is reading I mean there's wisdom that you're gonna think what everybody else is thinking So you need the diversity and almost like an index fund approach right where you're gonna catch the winners But you can't really identify a lot of them beforehand that they're going to change you as a person because so much about is contextual Yeah, I think almost everything that people read these days is designed for social approval You know all the best sellers are about social approval and social conditioning If you really wanted to be Successful happy blah blah blah all those external metrics You're looking for a non average outcome and so you can't be reading the average thing to your point (<a href="https://share.snipd.com/snip/91eb30bf-99fa-4c8a-980c-c1f94f8c0496">Time 1:16:31</a>)</li>
