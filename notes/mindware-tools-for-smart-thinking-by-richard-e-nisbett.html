    Mindware  Tools for Smart Thinking by Richard E. Nisbett
  </h2>
  <div class="content"><pre><code>&gt; (Highly recommended) Richard Nisbett, a world-renowned psychologist, explores how scientific and philosophical concepts change the way we solve problems by helping us think better. Weâ€™re talking [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/) like the law of large numbers, statistical regression, cost-benefit analysis, sunk costs, opportunity costs, and causation and correlation. The point of the book is to show us new ways to frame problems that allow us to apply these mental models.
