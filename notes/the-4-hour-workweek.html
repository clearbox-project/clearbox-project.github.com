<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>The manifesto of the dealmaker is simple: Reality is negotiable. Outside of science and law, all rules can be bent or broken, and it doesn’t require being unethical. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=289">Location 289</a>)</li>
<li>Options—the ability to choose—is real power. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=455">Location 455</a>)</li>
<li><ol>
<li>Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=568">Location 568</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2">
<li>Interest and Energy Are Cyclical. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=582">Location 582</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3">
<li>Less Is Not Laziness. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=593">Location 593</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4">
<li>The Timing Is Never Right. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=602">Location 602</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="5">
<li>Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=609">Location 609</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="6">
<li>Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=614">Location 614</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead of constant repair. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=619">Location 619</a>)</li>
<li><ol start="7">
<li>Things in Excess Become Their Opposite. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=622">Location 622</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Pacifists become militants. Freedom fighters become tyrants. Blessings become curses. Help becomes hindrance. More becomes less. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=624">Location 624</a>)</li>
<li>Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time, which is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=629">Location 629</a>)</li>
<li><ol start="8">
<li>Money Alone Is Not the Solution. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=631">Location 631</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="9">
<li>Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=640">Location 640</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="10">
<li>Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=656">Location 656</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action. —BENJAMIN DISRAELI, former British Prime Minister (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=713">Location 713</a>)</li>
<li>Most people will choose unhappiness over uncertainty. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=716">Location 716</a>)</li>
<li>The truth was, nothing was wrong with me. I hadn’t reached my limit; I’d reached the limit of my business model at the time. It wasn’t the driver, it was the vehicle. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=722">Location 722</a>)</li>
<li>Conquering Fear = Defining Fear (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=736">Location 736</a>)</li>
<li>Fear itself is quite fear-inducing. Most intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=761">Location 761</a>)</li>
<li>Do you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking and an excuse for inaction? If you were confident in improvement, would you really be questioning things so? Generally not. This is fear of the unknown disguised as optimism. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=764">Location 764</a>)</li>
<li>What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=811">Location 811</a>)</li>
<li>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man. —GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, Maxims for Revolutionists (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=834">Location 834</a>)</li>
<li>Doing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=857">Location 857</a>)</li>
<li>If you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself. You are better than you think. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=862">Location 862</a>)</li>
<li>Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. It is the cure-all. When people suggest you follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement. This brings us full circle. The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are my goals?” but “What would excite me?” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=883">Location 883</a>)</li>
<li>boredom is the enemy, not some abstract “failure.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=910">Location 910</a>)</li>
<li>Marrinan said, explaining his perseverance. “I deal with rejection by persisting, not by taking my business elsewhere. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=955">Location 955</a>)</li>
<li>‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ You won’t believe what you can accomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=956">Location 956</a>)</li>
<li>The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom. —VIKTOR FRANKL, Auschwitz survivor and founder of Logotherapy, Man’s Search for Meaning (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=965">Location 965</a>)</li>
<li>develop the uncommon habit of making decisions, both for yourself and for others. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1047">Location 1047</a>)</li>
<li>Learn to Eye Gaze (2 days) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1053">Location 1053</a>)</li>
<li>One does not accumulate but eliminate. It is not daily increase but daily decrease. The height of cultivation always runs to simplicity. —BRUCE LEE (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1063">Location 1063</a>)</li>
<li>Perfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away. —ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPÉRY, pioneer of international postal flight and author of Le Petit Prince (The Little Prince) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1068">Location 1068</a>)</li>
<li>It is vain to do with more what can be done with less. —WILLIAM OF OCCAM (1300–1350), originator of “Occam’s Razor” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1070">Location 1070</a>)</li>
<li><ol>
<li>Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? 2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1136">Location 1136</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate action. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1187">Location 1187</a>)</li>
<li>Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1221">Location 1221</a>)</li>
<li><ol>
<li>Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20). 2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1227">Location 1227</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1229">Location 1229</a>)</li>
<li>Am I being productive or just active? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1259">Location 1259</a>)</li>
<li>Am I inventing things to do to avoid the important? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1260">Location 1260</a>)</li>
<li>We create stress for ourselves because you feel like you have to do it. You have to. I don’t feel that anymore. —OPRAH WINFREY, actress and talk-show host, The Oprah Winfrey Show (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1265">Location 1265</a>)</li>
<li>What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence, a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. —HERBERT SIMON, recipient of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics8 and the A.M. Turing Award, the “Nobel Prize of Computer Science” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1364">Location 1364</a>)</li>

<li>Focus on what digerati Kathy Sierra calls “just-in-time” information instead of “just-in-case” information. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1465">Location 1465</a>)</li>
<li>More is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times better than finishing it. Develop the habit of nonfinishing that which is boring or unproductive if a boss isn’t demanding it. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1470">Location 1470</a>)</li>
<li>Do your own thinking independently. Be the chess player, not the chess piece.      —RALPH CHARELL (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1490">Location 1490</a>)</li>

<li>A schedule defends from chaos and whim. —ANNIE DILLARD, winner of Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, 1975 (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1667">Location 1667</a>)</li>
<li>There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to resume a major task that has been interrupted. More than a quarter of each 9–5 period (28%) is consumed by such interruptions.13 (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1681">Location 1681</a>)</li>

<li>If you are a micromanaging entrepreneur, realize that even if you can do something better than the rest of the world, it doesn’t mean that’s what you should be doing if it’s part of the minutiae. Empower others to act without interrupting you. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1751">Location 1751</a>)</li>
<li>SET THE RULES in your favor: Limit access to your time, force people to define their requests before spending time with them, and batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important projects. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B002WE46UW&amp;location=1752">Location 1752</a>)</li>
