<ul>
<li>When you see a developer, ask what they’re working on, and what customer problem it’s going to solve. Do they know? Ask when they last interacted with a customer, and how it made them feel. Did it motivate them? Ask what they learned that surprised them.</li>
<li>If you can try things in a low-risk way and quickly learn about your customers’ needs, why wouldn’t you?</li>
