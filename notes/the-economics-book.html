<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>"In economics, hope and faith coexist with great scientific pretension and also a deep desire for respectability." John Kenneth Galbraith (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Q9N8P9A&amp;location=149">Location 149</a>)</li>
<li>"The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics." Thomas Sowell US economist (1930–) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Q9N8P9A&amp;location=164">Location 164</a>)</li>
<li>Economies, however, are man-made and are dependent on the rational or irrational behavior of the humans that act within them, so economics as a science has more in common with the “soft sciences” of psychology, sociology, and politics. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Q9N8P9A&amp;location=179">Location 179</a>)</li>
<li>“the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Q9N8P9A&amp;location=182">Location 182</a>)</li>
<li>market economy. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Q9N8P9A&amp;location=191">Location 191</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: since industrial revolution</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Smith suggested that the market is guided by an “invisible hand,” where the rational actions of self-interested individuals ultimately give the wider society exactly what it needs. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Q9N8P9A&amp;location=193">Location 193</a>)</li>
<li>"Economics is, at root, the study of incentives: how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing." Steven D. Levitt, Stephen J. Dubner US economists (1967– and 1963–) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Q9N8P9A&amp;location=209">Location 209</a>)</li>
