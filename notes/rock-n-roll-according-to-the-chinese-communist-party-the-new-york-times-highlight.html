<li>Document Note: In an attempt to co-opt a popular indie rock song that was widely seen as elegizing the painful side effects of China’s modernization, the Communist Youth League in Hebei Province rewrote nearly the entire song with a new set of lyrics. The song, "Kill That One from Shijiazhuang," tells the story of a family's disillusionment and hopelessness in the industrial city of Shijiazhuang. The new version of the song maintains the musical structure, but replaces the original's bleak and mournful atmosphere with generic slogans about marching forward and joyful celebrations of what comes after. Despite this, the reaction to the revised effort has been unimpressed.</li>
