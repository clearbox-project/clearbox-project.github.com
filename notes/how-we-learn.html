<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>Transfer is what learning is all about, really. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00IWTTNZE&amp;location=2297">Location 2297</a>)</li>
<li>Whenever researchers scrambled practice sessions, in one form or another, people improved more over time than if their practice was focused and uninterrupted. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00IWTTNZE&amp;location=2315">Location 2315</a>)</li>
<li>“New Conceptualizations of Practice,” published in 1992, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00IWTTNZE&amp;location=2338">Location 2338</a>)</li>
<li>“At the most superficial level, it appears that systematically altering practice so as to encourage additional, or at least different, information processing activities can degrade performance during practice, but can at the same time have the effect of generating greater performance capabilities.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00IWTTNZE&amp;location=2341">Location 2341</a>)</li>
<li>In their Forget to Learn theory, Robert and Elizabeth Bjork called any technique that causes forgetting a “desirable difficulty,” in that it forces the brain to work harder to dig up a memory or skill—and that added work intensifies subsequent retrieval and storage strength (learning). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00IWTTNZE&amp;location=2347">Location 2347</a>)</li>
<li>Interleaving. That’s a cognitive science word, and it simply means mixing related but distinct material during study. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00IWTTNZE&amp;location=2404">Location 2404</a>)</li>
<li>Interleaving is not just about review but also discriminating between types of problems, moves, or concepts. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00IWTTNZE&amp;location=2499">Location 2499</a>)</li>
<li>Mixed-up practice doesn’t just build overall dexterity and prompt active discrimination. It helps prepare us for life’s curveballs, literal and figurative. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00IWTTNZE&amp;location=2517">Location 2517</a>)</li>
