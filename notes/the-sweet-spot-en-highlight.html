<ul>
<li>benign masochism involves experiences that aren’t harmful or destructive in the long run. These kinds of experiences can actually make our lives more pleasurable. (Location 26)</li>
<li>The thing is, the pleasure of the island lies in the fact that the rest of the year we’re not on it. (Location 35)</li>
<li>Pleasure exists in the stark contrast between normal life and that ideal life. It exists in the space between a hot, brief-but-intense pain, and the following relief and rush of endorphins. And even before we get to the pleasurable experience itself, we have the exquisite delight of the anticipation while we’re slogging through the tough part. (Location 36)</li>
<li>those moments of pain actually amplify our pleasure later on. They create a sharp contrast that allows us to notice, appreciate, and enjoy good things – a contrast that makes the good stuff feel even better. (Location 39)</li>
<li>pain can get us out of our heads. (Location 42)</li>
<li>BDSM stands for “Bondage, Domination, Submission, Masochism.” It’s a sexual practice that’s been popularized by books like 50 Shades of Grey, and it’s a practice that involves power play, where one partner dominates another, sometimes with the use of pain. (Location 43)</li>
<li>The pain provides an experience that people usually only find in advanced meditation: a temporary stop on all other thoughts. (Location 50)</li>
<li>there are less violent and dramatic ways to be in the moment that also bring satisfaction to our lives. And many of these are achieved not through benign masochism, but through effort – the value derived from engaging in taxing or seemingly unpleasant activities. Effort. (Location 53)</li>
<li>The answer to that takes us back to the idea of being present. Researcher Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi writes about flow states: times in our lives when we’re completely engaged and absorbed in whatever we’re doing, when it feels like time stands still, and all other worries fade away. (Location 61)</li>
<li>Entering into this state of flow means engaging in something that provides just the right amount of challenge – finding the “sweet spot” between a task that’s too easy and boring, and one that’s too difficult. (Location 63)</li>
<li>But there’s more to it. The most rewarding, effortful tasks give us the satisfactions of mastery. We can feel ourselves progressing, getting better, gaining skills, and conquering a challenge. And therein lies the magic and value of “effort.” (Location 65)</li>
<li>Renowned psychiatrist Viktor Frankl studied human resilience and flourishing in horrific circumstances. He found that people who felt their lives had a broader purpose – or meaning – were more resilient. (Location 70)</li>
<li>It makes them feel like their lives have value, that they mean something because of the potential legacy of that sacrifice.But (Location 79)</li>
<li>If you ask them if they do, they’ll almost always say no. (Location 86)
<ul>
<li>Note: 这是幸存者偏差吗?或者至少这里面有一些人类后理性化心理的影响?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In a singular, magical turn in life, your existence is no longer just about you – it’s about somebody else. (Location 89)</li>
<li>The pain – if you will – of having children isn’t about benign masochism or about the joy of being absorbed in a specific task. It’s about something deeper, something that author Zadie Smith eloquently describes as “a strange admixture of terror, pain and delight.” (Location 93)</li>
<li>Not everybody chooses to have children. Not everybody chooses to join an army or to climb Mt. Everest. But everyone shares in the need for a life lived with purpose, or with meaning. (Location 96)</li>
<li>So, the question then becomes: What kind of pain and difficulty and effort hurts as much as it’s worth? (Location 97)</li>
<li>So a much better question is: What gives your life meaning? (Location 103)</li>
</ul>
