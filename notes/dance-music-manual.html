<li>You can have all the music plug-ins in the world but that doesn’t make you an artist or an EDM producer – it just makes you a collector. The only secret to producing great dance music is through knowing what to use, when to use it and how to use it… R. Snoman (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=105">Location 105</a>)</li>
<li>To be successful as an EDM artist today, you need to be fluent in music theory, composition, arranging, recording, synthesis, sound design, producing, mixing, mastering and promotion, and have an understanding of computers. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=116">Location 116</a>)</li>
<li>Even something as simple in appearance as the basic house drum loop requires knowledge of synthesis, compression, reverb, delay, filters, limiters and mixing alongside techniques such as syncopation, polymeter, polyrhythm, hyperbeat, compound time and both frequency and pitch modulation. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=120">Location 120</a>)</li>
<li>it is important to first note that these smaller black notes can be referred to by more than one name. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=172">Location 172</a>)</li>
<li>rather than being described as a somber modal form, minor would probably be better described as sounding more serious or focused than a major key. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=218">Location 218</a>)</li>
<li>However, while the natural minor can provide pleasing intervals between notes, many musicians consider them to sound disjointed or displaced when writing harmonies and melodies, and therefore, both the harmonic and melodic minor scales were introduced. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=272">Location 272</a>)</li>
<li>it’s generally accepted that if you choose to write in a minor key, it’s best to use the notes in melodic minor for all instruments with the exception of any chords or chord progressions whereby it is best to use the harmonic minor for these. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=283">Location 283</a>)</li>
<li>From my experience of writing, producing and analysing music in this field, most dance records are written in A minor, D minor or E minor. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=314">Location 314</a>)</li>
<li>the most influential and powerful area for dance music’s bass reproduction on a club speaker system is 50 to 65 Hz, and the root note of A1 sits at 55 Hz. Since the music will naturally modulate or gravitate around the root note in your chosen key, having the root note of the music at 55 Hz will help to maintain the bass ‘groove’ energy of the record at a particularly useful frequency. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=327">Location 327</a>)</li>
<li>A motif is a short rhythmical idea that provides listeners with a reference point for the track. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=337">Location 337</a>)</li>
<li>From this we can determine that there are three essential elements to creating any motif, and these are simplicity, rhythmical repetition, and small variations. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=373">Location 373</a>)</li>
<li>A general benchmark to a memorable motif is the ability to hum it. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=380">Location 380</a>)</li>
<li>When a subsequent note falls in the scale, it can produce two results, the impression of pulling our emotion downwards, or making the motif sounding more serious. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=387">Location 387</a>)</li>
<li>When a note increases in pitch its high-frequency content increases, and higher frequencies tend to project a happier, lighter vibe. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=389">Location 389</a>)</li>
<li>In direct relation to the pitch moving up and down the scale affecting our emotion or interpretation of the record, the amount the pitch moves by can also directly influence our emotion in regard to the energy it conveys. If a motif consists of large pitch jumps from one note to the next and of more than two or three tones at a time, it will make a motif sound more energetic than one that simply steps up or down the scale. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=399">Location 399</a>)</li>
<li>With the possible exception of uplifting trance, club-based music relies more on its rhythmical energy than it does pitch, and much of this energy is introduced via processing and automated synthesis, not via huge pitch fluctuations throughout the motif. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=412">Location 412</a>)</li>
<li>‘A painter paints pictures on canvas. But musicians paint their pictures on silence.’ Leopold Stokowski (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=419">Location 419</a>)</li>
<li>Harmony can be described as a series of chords played sequentially to create a chord progression. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=427">Location 427</a>)</li>
<li>when there is a reduction of one semitone on the fifth interval, it results in a diminished chord. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=504">Location 504</a>)</li>
<li><ol>
<li>If the producer constructs a triad chord from the first, fourth or fifth note in any major key, it will result in a major triad. 2. If the producer constructs from the second, third or sixth note in a major key, it results in a minor triad. 3. The producer can quickly change a minor triad into a major triad by moving the bottom interval (third) up by a semitone. Moving a note up by a semitone is known as augmenting. 4. If the producer constructs from the seventh note in a major key, it will always result in a diminished triad. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=507">Location 507</a>)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Seventh, ninth, eleventh and thirteenth chords can prove useful for thickening up synthesized timbres for large sounding pads and chords. Typically, genres such as Uplifting Trance, Funky House, House and Tech House will employ ninth and eleventh chords in the breakdown since the mix at this point becomes sparse and relies entirely on the chords to carry the music. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=541">Location 541</a>)</li>
<li>the choice of chords and how they progress from one to another will determine the energy and mood of the music. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=564">Location 564</a>)</li>
<li>The familiarity, even predictability, of some paired chord progressions comes from the use of what is often termed natural or strong progression. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=578">Location 578</a>)</li>
<li>the producer can create a number of strong sounding progressions using any chords provided they ensure the root notes of chords are four notes up or five notes down from the leading tone, or third note of the preceding chord. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=621">Location 621</a>)</li>
<li>whilst it is certainly a very useful formula for constructing natural sounding progressions, if does tend to sound predictable and hence, boring. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=638">Location 638</a>)</li>
<li>By moving from a strong chord pairing to a weaker pairing it can sometimes appear misplaced or ill fitting for the song. If this occurs, a generally accepted technique is to lead into a weak chord pairing but immediately follow that with a strong chord. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=659">Location 659</a>)</li>
<li>A typical example would be trip-hop, a genre of EDM that relies on melancholy progressions that are often created through relying on a large number of weak progression pairs throughout the verses but resolves to stronger chord progressions during the chorus sections. This approach can often help to create the emotion of the song, making the music appear particularly anxious during the verse but more confident during the chorus. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=670">Location 670</a>)</li>
<li>First, when producing a progression in a minor key, the most commonly used chords happen to be the I – iv and VI, compared to I – IV and V of the major scale. Second, when a producer composes a progression in a minor key, there is an almost instinctual urge to move to a major key. As a consequence it isn’t unusual to move from a minor progression to major during specific parts of a production. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=679">Location 679</a>)</li>
<li>In some dance music styles such as French House, this is typically in the bridge and when this occurs, it’s not unusual to use inversions of the same chord whilst the bass remains at either the tonic or dominant note of the chord. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=690">Location 690</a>)</li>
<li>By inserting a first or second inversion between these, the inversion becomes known as a passing chord, since it provides the feeling of passing over to the next note in the progression. However, inversions should be used sparingly and with some forethought to the harmonic journey of the music. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=701">Location 701</a>)</li>
<li>This style of inversion and progression is not as weak as other chords with less of a relationship, but they nevertheless do come across as unstable, and therefore, they shouldn’t be used to end a progression. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=708">Location 708</a>)</li>
<li>Typically, the I, IV and V often benefit from the addition of a fourth note to create the seventh chord but of these the most popular approach is to only modify the V chord. The creation of a seventh here creates a dominant function since it serves to increase the feeling that the music wants to return to the tonic, or key of the music. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=711">Location 711</a>)</li>
<li>If the producer adds a major seventh to the V chord and doesn’t return to the tonic, its advisable to move to the vi, then IV, then V and finally to I. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=721">Location 721</a>)</li>
<li>Chords can be suspended by simply augmenting the bottom interval (third interval) by a semitone. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=724">Location 724</a>)</li>
<li>Irrespective of what chord the producer chooses to suspend, it should generally be resolved immediately afterwards by returning to a standard chord. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00FYR3510&amp;location=729">Location 729</a>)</li>
