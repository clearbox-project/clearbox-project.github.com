<ul>
<li>First, Break All the Rules1</li>
<li>Managers who care about you as a person, and who actively work to help you grow in your career. Managers who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback. Managers who help you navigate difficult situations, who help you figure out what you need to learn. Managers who want you to take their job someday. And most importantly, managers who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus</li>
<li>The sooner you know about your bad habits, the easier they are to correct</li>
<li>Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable than waiting for a convenient time to say something.</li>
<li>My specific advice would be to seek out a workplace where you can get mentorship and training in the aspects of doing the job (such as testing, project and product management, and collaboration) as well as learn new technical skills.</li>
<li>Try to find people to work for who push you to succeed but also reward you for success, who inspire you to stretch yourself.</li>
<li>not relying on your manager to set the entire tone for your relationship</li>
<li>Asking for advice is always a good way to show respect and trust.</li>
</ul>
