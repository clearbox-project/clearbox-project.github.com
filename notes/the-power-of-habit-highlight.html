<ul>
<li>Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=446">Location 446</a>)</li>
<li>To deal with this uncertainty, the brain spends a lot of effort at the beginning of a habit looking for something—a cue—that offers a hint as to which pattern to use. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=459">Location 459</a>)</li>
<li>This process within our brains is a three-step loop. First, there is a cue, a trigger that tells your brain to go into automatic mode and which habit to use. Then there is the routine, which can be physical or mental or emotional. Finally, there is a reward, which helps your brain figure out if this particular loop is worth remembering for the future: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=462">Location 462</a>)</li>
<li>The cue and reward become intertwined until a powerful sense of anticipation and craving emerges. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=466">Location 466</a>)</li>
<li>When a habit emerges, the brain stops fully participating in decision making. It stops working so hard, or diverts focus to other tasks. So unless you deliberately fight a habit—unless you find new routines—the pattern will unfold automatically. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=470">Location 470</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: I can start fhe artical by talk about how real program help us, by automating the routines.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Researchers have learned that cues can be almost anything, from a visual trigger such as a candy bar or a television commercial to a certain place, a time of day, an emotion, a sequence of thoughts, or the company of particular people. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=553">Location 553</a>)</li>
<li>Routines can be incredibly complex or fantastically simple (some habits, such as those related to emotions, are measured in milliseconds). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=554">Location 554</a>)</li>
<li>Rewards can range from food or drugs that cause physical sensations, to emotional payoffs, such as the feelings of pride that accompany praise or self-congratulation. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=555">Location 555</a>)</li>
<li>Eugene Pauly taught us about the habit loop, but it was Claude Hopkins that showed how new habits can be cultivated and grown. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=666">Location 666</a>)</li>
<li>He created a craving. And that craving, it turns out, is what makes cues and rewards work. That craving is what powers the habit loop. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=667">Location 667</a>)</li>
<li>First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the rewards. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=703">Location 703</a>)</li>
<li>P&amp;G collected more data than almost any other merchant on earth and relied on complex statistical methods to craft their marketing campaigns. The firm was incredibly good at figuring out how to sell things. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=725">Location 725</a>)</li>
<li>As the monkey became more and more practiced at the behavior—as the habit became stronger and stronger—Julio’s brain began anticipating the blackberry juice. Schultz’s probes started recording the “I got a reward!” pattern the instant Julio saw the shapes on the screen, before the juice arrived: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=853">Location 853</a>)</li>
<li>When the juice didn’t arrive or was late or diluted, Julio would get angry and make unhappy noises, or become mopey. And within Julio’s brain, Schultz watched a new pattern emerge: craving. When Julio anticipated juice but didn’t receive it, a neurological pattern associated with desire and frustration erupted inside his skull. When Julio saw the cue, he started anticipating a juice-fueled joy. But if the juice didn’t arrive, that joy became a craving that, if unsatisfied, drove Julio to anger or depression. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=861">Location 861</a>)</li>
<li>This explains why habits are so powerful: They create neurological cravings. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=872">Location 872</a>)</li>
<li>Particularly strong habits, wrote two researchers at the University of Michigan, produce addiction-like reactions so that “wanting evolves into obsessive craving” that can force our brains into autopilot, “even in the face of strong disincentives, including loss of reputation, job, home, and family.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=902">Location 902</a>)</li>
<li>countless studies have shown that a cue and a reward, on their own, aren’t enough for a new habit to last. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=919">Location 919</a>)</li>
<li>The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger a craving for the reward to come. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=921">Location 921</a>)</li>
<li>Frankly, I don’t even like this kind of food, but suddenly, it’s hard to fight this urge. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=928">Location 928</a>)</li>
<li>Febreze was positioned as the reward: the nice smell that occurs at the end of a cleaning routine. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=962">Location 962</a>)</li>
<li>“She made us think that Febreze would succeed by providing a solution to a problem. But who wants to admit their house stinks? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=969">Location 969</a>)</li>
<li>“We were looking at it all wrong. No one craves scentlessness. On the other hand, lots of people crave a nice smell after they’ve spent thirty minutes cleaning.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=970">Location 970</a>)</li>
<li>“Consumers need some kind of signal that a product is working,” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1012">Location 1012</a>)</li>
<li>Anyone can use this basic formula to create habits of her or his own. Want to exercise more? Choose a cue, such as going to the gym as soon as you wake up, and a reward, such as a smoothie after each workout. Then think about that smoothie, or about the endorphin rush you’ll feel. Allow yourself to anticipate the reward. Eventually, that craving will make it easier to push through the gym doors every day. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1015">Location 1015</a>)</li>
<li>They focused on the craving for that reward when temptations arose, cultivated the craving into a mild obsession. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1022">Location 1022</a>)</li>
<li>Cravings are what drive habits. And figuring out how to spark a craving makes creating a new habit easier. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1036">Location 1036</a>)</li>
<li>Rather, to change a habit, you must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new routine. That’s the rule: If you use the same cue, and provide the same reward, you can shift the routine and change the habit. Almost any behavior can be transformed if the cue and reward stay the same. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1074">Location 1074</a>)</li>
<li>to change an old habit, you must address an old craving. You have to keep the same cues and rewards as before, and feed the craving by inserting a new routine. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1197">Location 1197</a>)</li>
<li>create a list of all the triggers for their alcoholic urges,” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1201">Location 1201</a>)</li>
<li>What cravings, the program asks, are driving your habit loop? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1204">Location 1204</a>)</li>
<li>awareness training, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1254">Location 1254</a>)</li>
<li>“competing response.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1266">Location 1266</a>)</li>
<li>“It seems like it should be more complex. The truth is, the brain can be reprogrammed. You just have to be deliberate about it.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1277">Location 1277</a>)</li>
<li>It allowed Brooks to move faster, because everything was a reaction—and eventually a habit—rather than a choice. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1322">Location 1322</a>)</li>
<li>Identifying cues and choosing new routines is important, but without another ingredient, the new habits never fully took hold. The secret, the alcoholics said, was God. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1383">Location 1383</a>)</li>
<li>However, those alcoholics who believed, like John in Brooklyn, that some higher power had entered their lives were more likely to make it through the stressful periods with their sobriety intact. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1392">Location 1392</a>)</li>
<li>It wasn’t God that mattered, the researchers figured out. It was belief itself that made a difference. Once people learned how to believe in something, that skill started spilling over to other parts of their lives, until they started believing they could change. Belief was the ingredient that made a reworked habit loop into a permanent behavior. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1394">Location 1394</a>)</li>
<li>You don’t have to believe in God, but you do need the capacity to believe that things will get better. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1398">Location 1398</a>)</li>
<li>What can make a difference is believing that they can cope with that stress without alcohol.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1400">Location 1400</a>)</li>
<li>trains people in how to believe in something until they believe in the program and themselves. It lets people practice believing that things will eventually get better, until things actually do. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1402">Location 1402</a>)</li>
<li>it felt good to do something that wasn’t all about me (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1409">Location 1409</a>)</li>
<li>just as often, a similar belief can emerge without any kind of adversity. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1447">Location 1447</a>)</li>
<li>researchers found that some people had remade their habits after a personal tragedy, such as a divorce or a life-threatening illness. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1449">Location 1449</a>)</li>
<li>There are simply communities—sometimes of just one other person—who make change believable. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1458">Location 1458</a>)</li>
<li>“Change occurs among other people,” one of the psychologists involved in the study, Todd Heatherton, told me. “It seems real when we can see it in other people’s eyes.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1461">Location 1461</a>)</li>
<li>But we do know that for habits to permanently change, people must believe that change is feasible. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1465">Location 1465</a>)</li>
<li>Belief is easier when it occurs within a community. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0055PGUYU&amp;location=1467">Location 1467</a>)</li>
