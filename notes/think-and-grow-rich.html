<li>Money and material things are essential for freedom of body and mind, but there are some who will feel that the greatest of all riches can be evaluated only in terms of lasting friendships, harmonious family relationships, sympathy and understanding between business associates, and introspective harmony which brings one peace of mind measurable only in spiritual values! (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=82">Location 82</a>)</li>
<li>All achievement, all earned riches, have their beginning in an idea! (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=183">Location 183</a>)</li>
<li>What a different story men would have to tell if only they would adopt a definite purpose, and stand by that purpose until it had time to become an all-consuming obsession! (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=214">Location 214</a>)</li>
<li>That is one of the tricks of opportunity. It has a sly habit of slipping in by the back door, and often it comes disguised in the form of misfortune, or temporary defeat. Perhaps this is why so many fail to recognize opportunity. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=218">Location 218</a>)</li>
<li>One of the most common causes of failure is the habit of quitting when one is overtaken by temporary defeat. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=235">Location 235</a>)</li>
<li>“No” does not necessarily mean no. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=265">Location 265</a>)</li>
<li>Success comes to those who become success conscious. Failure comes to those who indifferently allow themselves to become failure conscious. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=331">Location 331</a>)</li>
<li>Barnes succeeded because he chose a definite goal, placed all his energy, all his will power, all his effort, everything back of that goal. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=427">Location 427</a>)</li>
<li>power of a definite desire. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=432">Location 432</a>)</li>
<li>Every person who wins in any undertaking must be willing to burn his ships and cut all sources of retreat. Only by so doing can one be sure of maintaining that state of mind known as a burning desire to win, essential to success. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=447">Location 447</a>)</li>
<li>Every human being who reaches the age of understanding of the purpose of money, wishes for it. Wishing will not bring riches. But desiring riches with a state of mind that becomes an obsession, then planning definite ways and means to acquire riches, and backing those plans with persistence which does not recognize failure, will bring riches. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=458">Location 458</a>)</li>
<li>First. Fix in your mind the exact amount of money you desire. It is not sufficient merely to say “I want plenty of money.” Be definite as to the amount. (There is a psychological reason for definiteness which will be described in a subsequent chapter). Second. Determine exactly what you intend to give in return for the money you desire. (There is no such reality as “something for nothing.) Third. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire. Fourth. Create a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into action. Fifth. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to give in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it. Sixth. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. As you read— see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=462">Location 462</a>)</li>
<li>If you do not see great riches in your imagination, you will never see them in your bank balance. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=490">Location 490</a>)</li>
<li>definiteness of purpose, the knowledge of what one wants, and a burning desire to possess it. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=498">Location 498</a>)</li>
<li>“success requires no apologies, failure permits no alibis.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=512">Location 512</a>)</li>
<li>“The greatest achievement was, at first, and for a time, but a dream.” “The oak sleeps in the acorn. The bird waits in the egg, and in the highest vision of the soul, a waking angel stirs. Dreams are the seedlings of reality.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=530">Location 530</a>)</li>
<li>There is a difference between Wishing for a thing and being ready to receive it. No one is ready for a thing, until he believes he can acquire it. The state of mind must be belief, not mere hope or wish. Open-mindedness is essential for belief. Closed minds do not inspire faith, courage, and belief. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=565">Location 565</a>)</li>
<li>A mind dominated by positive emotions, becomes a favorable abode for the state of mind known as faith. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=774">Location 774</a>)</li>
<li>faith is the “eternal elixir” which gives life, power, and action to the impulse of thought! (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=781">Location 781</a>)</li>
<li>faith is the starting point of all accumulation of riches! faith is the basis of all “miracles,” and all mysteries which cannot be analyzed by the rules of science! faith is the only known antidote for failure! faith is the element, the “chemical” which, when mixed with prayer, gives one direct communication with Infinite Intelligence. faith is the element which transforms the ordinary vibration of thought, created by the finite mind of man, into the spiritual equivalent. faith is the only agency through which the cosmic force of Infinite Intelligence can be harnessed and used by man. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AIR8CMS&amp;location=783">Location 783</a>)</li>
<li>Resolve to throw off the influences of any unfortunate environment, and to build your own life to order. Taking inventory of mental assets and liabilities, you will discover that your greatest weakness is lack of self-confidence. This handicap can be surmounted, and timidity translated into courage, through the aid of the principle of autosuggestion. The application of this principle may be made through a simple arrangement of positive thought impulses stated in writing, memorized, and repeated, until they become a part of the working equipment of the subconscious faculty of your mind.
