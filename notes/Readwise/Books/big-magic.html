<li>He told them that they must live their most creative lives as a means of fighting back against the ruthless furnace of this world. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00S52M350&amp;location=81">Location 81</a>)</li>
<li>The universe buries strange jewels deep within us all, and then stands back to see if we can find them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00S52M350&amp;location=100">Location 100</a>)</li>
<li>I’m talking about living a life that is driven more strongly by curiosity than by fear. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00S52M350&amp;location=108">Location 108</a>)</li>
<li>A creative life is an amplified life. It’s a bigger life, a happier life, an expanded life, and a hell of a lot more interesting life. Living in this manner—continually and stubbornly bringing forth the jewels that are hidden within you—is a fine art, in and of itself. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00S52M350&amp;location=134">Location 134</a>)</li>
<li>You can measure your worth by your dedication to your path, not by your successes or failures. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00S52M350&amp;location=369">Location 369</a>)</li>
<li>Most dangerously of all, such thinking assumes that if you cannot win, then you must not continue to play. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00S52M350&amp;location=640">Location 640</a>)</li>
<li>Possessing a creative mind, after all, is something like having a border collie for a pet: It needs to work, or else it will cause you an outrageous amount of trouble. Give your mind a job to do, or else it will find a job to do, and you might not like the job it invents (eating the couch, digging a hole through the living room floor, biting the mailman, etc.). It has taken me years to learn this, but it does seem to be the case that if I am not actively creating something, then I am probably actively destroying something (myself, a relationship, or my own peace of mind).
