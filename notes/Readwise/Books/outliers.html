<ul>
<li>Barnsley argues that these kinds of skewed age distributions exist whenever three things happen: selection, streaming, and differentiated experience. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=269">Location 269</a>)</li>
<li>Success is the result of what sociologists like to call “accumulative advantage.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=326">Location 326</a>)</li>
<li>Achievement is talent plus preparation. The problem with this view is that the closer psychologists look at the careers of the gifted, the smaller the role innate talent seems to play and the bigger the role preparation seems to play. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=412">Location 412</a>)</li>
<li>Their research suggests that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That’s it. And what’s more, the people at the very top don’t work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=431">Location 431</a>)</li>
<li>Practice isn’t the thing you do once you’re good. It’s the thing you do that makes you good. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=458">Location 458</a>)</li>
<li>“that intellect and achievement are far from perfectly correlated.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=964">Location 964</a>)</li>
<li>To Sternberg, practical intelligence includes things like “knowing what to say to whom, knowing when to say it, and knowing how to say it for maximum effect.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1089">Location 1089</a>)</li>
<li>general intelligence and practical intelligence are “orthogonal”: the presence of one doesn’t imply the presence of the other. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1093">Location 1093</a>)</li>
<li>Her mother arranges for her to be retested privately, petitions the school, and gets her daughter admitted. The poor parents, by contrast, are intimidated by authority. They react passively and stay in the background. Lareau writes of one low-income parent: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1122">Location 1122</a>)</li>
<li>Lareau calls the middle-class parenting style “concerted cultivation.” It’s an attempt to actively “foster and assess a child’s talents, opinions and skills.” Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast, a strategy of “accomplishment of natural growth.” They see as their responsibility to care for their children but to let them grow and develop on their own. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1129">Location 1129</a>)</li>
<li>Terman ran through every conceivable explanation. He looked at their physical and mental health, their “masculinity-femininity scores,” and their hobbies and vocational interests. He compared the ages when they started walking and talking and what their precise IQ scores were in elementary and high school. In the end, only one thing mattered: family background. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1216">Location 1216</a>)</li>
<li>Those three things—autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward—are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1638">Location 1638</a>)</li>
<li>Hard work is a prison sentence only if it does not have meaning. Once it does, it becomes the kind of thing that makes you grab your wife around the waist and dance a jig. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1649">Location 1649</a>)</li>
<li>if you work hard enough and assert yourself, and use your mind and imagination, you can shape the world to your desires. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1654">Location 1654</a>)</li>
<li>that’s what a “culture of honor” means. It’s a world where a man’s reputation is at the center of his livelihood and self-worth. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=1795">Location 1795</a>)</li>
<li>Each of us has his or her own distinct personality. But overlaid on top of that are tendencies and assumptions and reflexes handed down to us by the history of the community we grew up in, and those differences are extraordinarily specific. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=2202">Location 2202</a>)</li>
<li>Cultural legacies matter, and once we’ve seen the surprising effects of such things as power distance and numbers that can be said in a quarter as opposed to a third of a second, it’s hard not to wonder how many other cultural legacies have an impact on our twenty-first-century intellectual tasks. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=2514">Location 2514</a>)</li>
<li>Success is a function of persistence and doggedness and the willingness to work hard for twenty-two minutes to make sense of something that most people would give up on after thirty seconds. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=2667">Location 2667</a>)</li>
<li>In other words, countries whose students are willing to concentrate and sit still long enough and focus on answering every single question in an endless questionnaire are the same countries whose students do the best job of solving math problems. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=2681">Location 2681</a>)</li>
<li>Outliers are those who have been given opportunities—and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=2908">Location 2908</a>)</li>
<li>The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B001ANYDAO&amp;location=3104">Location 3104</a>)</li>
