<ul>
<li>Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundations for behavior that gets you what you want out of life. They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=68">Location 68</a>)</li>
<li>To be principled means to consistently operate with principles that can be clearly explained. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=74">Location 74</a>)</li>
<li>If you can think for yourself while being open-minded in a clearheaded way to find out what is best for you to do, and if you can summon up the courage to do it, you will make the most of your life. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=90">Location 90</a>)</li>
<li>my first principle: • Think for yourself to decide 1) what you want, 2) what is true, and 3) what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2 . . . . . . and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=92">Location 92</a>)</li>
<li>The worst thing you can be is a phony, because if you’re a phony you will lose people’s trust and your own self-respect. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=104">Location 104</a>)</li>
<li>I believe that the key to success lies in knowing how to both strive for a lot and fail well. By failing well, I mean being able to experience painful failures that provide big learnings without failing badly enough to get knocked out of the game. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=113">Location 113</a>)</li>
<li>My painful mistakes shifted me from having a perspective of “I know I’m right” to having one of “How do I know I’m right?” They gave me the humility I needed to balance my audacity. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=124">Location 124</a>)</li>
<li>Experience taught me how invaluable it is to reflect on and write down my decision-making criteria whenever I made a decision, so I got in the habit of doing that. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=131">Location 131</a>)</li>
<li>The most important thing is that you develop your own principles and ideally write them down, especially if you are working with others. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=143">Location 143</a>)</li>
<li>I gradually learned that prices reflect people’s expectations, so they go up when actual results are better than expected and they go down when they are worse than expected. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=275">Location 275</a>)</li>
<li>Meditation has benefited me hugely throughout my life because it produces a calm open-mindedness that allows me to think more clearly and creatively. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=281">Location 281</a>)</li>
<li>Over the decades since, I’ve repeatedly seen policymakers deliver such assurances immediately before currency devaluations, so I learned not to believe government policymakers when they assure you that they won’t let a currency devaluation happen. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=322">Location 322</a>)</li>
<li>The more strongly they make those assurances, the more desperate the situation probably is, so the more likely it is that a devaluation will take place. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=324">Location 324</a>)</li>
<li>“You better make sense of what happened to other people in other times and other places because if you don’t you won’t know if these things can happen to you and, if they do, you won’t know how to deal with them.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=332">Location 332</a>)</li>
<li>we were given actual case studies to read and analyze. Then we gathered in groups to thrash out what we would do if we were in the shoes of the people in those situations. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=337">Location 337</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: “历史就该这么学”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Most everything has happened repeatedly before for logical cause-effect reasons. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=358">Location 358</a>)

<li>people chase what’s hot and avoid what’s not, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=361">Location 361</a>)
<ul>
<li>Tags: <a href="pink.html">pink</a> </li>
</ul></li>
<li>it’s always best to assume you’re missing something. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=446">Location 446</a>)</li>
<li>meaningful work is being on a mission I become engrossed in, and meaningful relationships are those I have with people I care deeply about and who care deeply about me. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=449">Location 449</a>)</li>
<li>It’s smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=452">Location 452</a>)</li>
<li>Timing is everything. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=529">Location 529</a>)</li>
<li>I again saw the value of studying history. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=605">Location 605</a>)</li>
<li>learning a better way of handling the natural aggressiveness I’ve always shown in going after what I wanted. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=613">Location 613</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: 在猎物面前流口水是下三滥的行为</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I learned a great fear of being wrong that shifted my mind-set from thinking “I’m right” to asking myself “How do I know I’m right?” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=619">Location 619</a>)</li>
<li>In other words, I just want to be right—I don’t care if the right answer comes from me. So I learned to be radically open-minded to allow others to point out what I might be missing. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=622">Location 622</a>)</li>
<li>1. Seek out the smartest people who disagreed with me so I could try to understand their reasoning. 2. Know when not to have an opinion. 3. Develop, test, and systemize timeless and universal principles. 4. Balance risks in ways that keep the big upside while reducing the downside. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=624">Location 624</a>)</li>
<li>I came to see that people’s greatest weaknesses are the flip sides of their greatest strengths. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=632">Location 632</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: 聪明 懒惰</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Successful people change in ways that allow them to continue to take advantage of their strengths while compensating for their weaknesses and unsuccessful people don’t. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=635">Location 635</a>)</li>
<li>There is almost always a good path that you just haven’t discovered yet, so look for it until you find it rather than settle for the choice that is then apparent to you. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=649">Location 649</a>)</li>
<li>what was most important wasn’t knowing the future—it was knowing how to react appropriately to the information available at each point in time. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=670">Location 670</a>)</li>
<li>I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=796">Location 796</a>)</li>
<li>Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=797">Location 797</a>)</li>
<li>I urge you to be curious enough to want to understand how the people who see things differently from you came to see them that way. You will find that interesting and invaluable, and the richer perspective you gain will help you decide what you should do. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=833">Location 833</a>)</li>
<li>most people are more emotional than logical, they tend to overreact to short-term results; they give up and sell low when times are bad and buy too high when times are good. I find this is just as true for relationships as it is for investments—wise people stick with sound fundamentals through the ups and downs, while flighty people react emotionally to how things feel, jumping into things when they’re hot and abandoning them when they’re not. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=885">Location 885</a>)</li>
<li>I have come to realize that bad times coupled with good reflections provide some of the best lessons, and not just about business but also about relationships. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=890">Location 890</a>)</li>
<li>I got a lot out of my bad times, not just because they gave me mistakes to learn from but also because they helped me find out who my real friends were—the friends who would be with me through thick and thin. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=892">Location 892</a>)</li>
<li>I didn’t value experience as much as character, creativity, and common sense, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=899">Location 899</a>)</li>
<li>From my earlier failures, I knew that no matter how confident I was in making any one bet I could still be wrong—and that proper diversification was the key to reducing risks without reducing returns. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=919">Location 919</a>)</li>
<li>Having a few good uncorrelated return streams is better than having just one, and knowing how to combine return streams is even more effective than being able to choose good ones (though of course you have to do both). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=936">Location 936</a>)</li>
<li>Making a handful of good uncorrelated bets that are balanced and leveraged well is the surest way of having a lot of upside without being exposed to unacceptable downside. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=954">Location 954</a>)</li>
<li>1. Put our honest thoughts out on the table, 2. Have thoughtful disagreements in which people are willing to shift their opinions as they learn, and 3. Have agreed-upon ways of deciding (e.g., voting, having clear authorities) if disagreements remain so that we can move beyond them without resentments. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1042">Location 1042</a>)</li>
<li>It is now generically called “risk parity” investing. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1121">Location 1121</a>)</li>
<li>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) assessment (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1181">Location 1181</a>)</li>
<li>In 2007, this gauge indicated that a bubble of debt was nearing its bursting point because the costs of debt service were outpacing projected cash flows. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1272">Location 1272</a>)</li>
<li>Because interest rates were so close to 0 percent, I knew that central banks could not ease monetary policy enough to reverse the downturn the way they had in prior recessions. This was the exact configuration that had led to past depressions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1273">Location 1273</a>)</li>
<li>Getting a lot of attention for being successful is a bad position to be in. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1362">Location 1362</a>)</li>
<li>they embrace the risk because the upside of succeeding is huge relative to the downside of having it not work out. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1393">Location 1393</a>)</li>
<li>They are all independent thinkers who do not let anything or anyone stand in the way of achieving their audacious goals. They have very strong mental maps of how things should be done, and at the same time a willingness to test those mental maps in the world of reality and change the ways they do things to make them work better. They are extremely resilient, because their need to achieve what they envision is stronger than the pain they experience as they struggle to achieve it. Perhaps most interesting, they have a wider range of vision than most people, either because they have that vision themselves or because they know how to get it from others who can see what they can’t. All are able to see both big pictures and granular details (and levels in between) and synthesize the perspectives they gain at those different levels, whereas most people see just one or the other. They are simultaneously creative, systematic, and practical. They are assertive and open-minded at the same time. Above all, they are passionate about what they are doing, intolerant of people who work for them who aren’t excellent at what they do, and want to have a big, beneficial impact on the world. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1481">Location 1481</a>)</li>
<li>When faced with a choice between achieving their goal or pleasing (or not disappointing) others, they would choose achieving their goal every time. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1508">Location 1508</a>)</li>
<li>Those that do best both see a wide range themselves while triangulating well with other brilliant people who see things in different, complementary ways. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1520">Location 1520</a>)</li>
<li>matching the right types of people to the right types of situations is key. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1524">Location 1524</a>)</li>
<li>How the Economic Machine Works, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1641">Location 1641</a>)</li>
<li>I gave Wang a copy of Joseph Campbell’s great book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, because he is a classic hero and I thought it might help him. I also gave him The Lessons of History, a 104-page distillation of the major forces through history by Will and Ariel Durant, and River Out of Eden by the insightful Richard Dawkins, which explains how evolution works. He gave me Georgi Plekhanov’s classic On the Role of the Individual in History. All these books showed how the same things happened over and over again throughout history. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1675">Location 1675</a>)</li>
<li>“Unattainable goals appeal to heroes,” he once told me. “Capable people are those who sit there worrying about the future. The unwise are those who worry about nothing. If conflicts got resolved before they became acute, there wouldn’t be any heroes.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1681">Location 1681</a>)</li>
<li>501(c)(3) foundation (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1735">Location 1735</a>)</li>
<li>Instead of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed, I saw pain as nature’s reminder that there is something important for me to learn. Encountering pains and figuring out the lessons they were trying to give me became sort of a game to me. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1879">Location 1879</a>)</li>
<li>In time, I realized that the satisfaction of success doesn’t come from achieving your goals, but from struggling well. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1888">Location 1888</a>)</li>
<li>Look to the patterns of those things that affect you in order to understand the cause-effect relationships that drive them and to learn principles for dealing with them effectively. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1924">Location 1924</a>)</li>
<li>people who create great things aren’t idle dreamers: They are totally grounded in reality. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1970">Location 1970</a>)</li>
<li>Learning is the product of a continuous real-time feedback loop in which we make decisions, see their outcomes, and improve our understanding of reality as a result. Being radically open-minded enhances the efficiency of those feedback loops, because it makes what you are doing, and why, so clear to yourself and others that there can’t be any misunderstandings. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=1995">Location 1995</a>)</li>
<li>To get good results, we need to be analytical rather than emotional. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2062">Location 2062</a>)</li>
<li>Evolution consists of adaptations/inventions that provide spurts of benefits that decline in value. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2098">Location 2098</a>)</li>
<li>rather than getting stuck hiding our mistakes and pretending we’re perfect, it makes sense to find our imperfections and deal with them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2107">Location 2107</a>)</li>
<li>What you will be will depend on the perspective you have. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2162">Location 2162</a>)</li>
<li>“Love and work are the cornerstones of our humanness.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2191">Location 2191</a>)</li>
<li>As Carl Jung put it, “Man needs difficulties. They are necessary for health.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2200">Location 2200</a>)</li>
<li>The best single clue as to whether you should go down this path is whether the thing you are trying to do is consistent with your nature (i.e., your natural abilities). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2319">Location 2319</a>)</li>
<li>If you limit your goals to what you know you can achieve, you are setting the bar way too low. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2450">Location 2450</a>)</li>
<li>your ego and your blind spots. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2577">Location 2577</a>)</li>
<li>Open-minded people know when to make statements and when to ask questions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2785">Location 2785</a>)</li>
<li>Closed-minded people block others from speaking. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2786">Location 2786</a>)</li>
<li>switch from a fighting mode to an “asking questions” mode, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2824">Location 2824</a>)</li>
<li>Transcendental Meditation (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2826">Location 2826</a>)</li>
<li>Our different ways of thinking led to our poor communications. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071CTK28D&amp;location=2936">Location 2936</a>)</li>
