<li>(This great quote from Close was featured recently on the site BrainPickings: “Ask yourself an interesting enough question3 and your attempt to find a tailor-made solution to that question will push you to a place where, pretty soon, you’ll find yourself all by your lonesome—which I think is a more interesting place to be.”) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=55">Location 55</a>)</li>
<li>Einstein saw curiosity as something “holy.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=60">Location 60</a>)</li>

<li>questions challenge authority and disrupt established structures, processes, and systems, forcing people to have to at least think about doing something differently. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=118">Location 118</a>)</li>
<li>The neurologist John Kounios observes8 that the brain finds ways to “reduce our mental workload,” and one way is to accept without question (or even to just ignore) much of what is going on around us at any time. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=125">Location 125</a>)</li>
<li>“We’ve transitioned into always transitioning,”9 according to the author and futurist John Seely Brown. In such times, the ability to ask big, meaningful, beautiful questions—and, just as important, to know what to do with those questions once they’ve been raised—can be the first steps in moving beyond old habits and behaviors as we embrace the new. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=132">Location 132</a>)

<li>ambitious, catalytic questioning tends to follow a logical progression, one that often starts with stepping back and seeing things differently and ends with taking action on a particular question. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=145">Location 145</a>)</li>
<li>A beautiful question is an ambitious yet actionable question that can begin to shift the way we perceive or think about something—and that might serve as a catalyst to bring about change. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=157">Location 157</a>)</li>
<li>The esteemed physicist Edward Witten10 told me that in his work he is always searching for “a question that is hard (and interesting) enough that it is worth answering and easy enough that one can actually answer it.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=164">Location 164</a>)</li>
<li>Phillips exhibited one of the telltale signs of an innovative questioner: a refusal to accept the existing reality. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=210">Location 210</a>)</li>
<li>One of the many interesting and appealing things about questioning is that it often has an inverse relationship to expertise—such that, within their own subject areas, experts are apt to be poor questioners. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=228">Location 228</a>)</li>
<li>“stopped thinking because he ‘knows.’” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=230">Location 230</a>)</li>
<li>He took ownership of that question, Why can’t they make a better foot? To do this, he had to make a change of pronouns: Specifically, he had to replace they with I. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=234">Location 234</a>)</li>
<li>Noonan observes that if you never actually do anything about a problem yourself, then you’re not really questioning—you’re complaining. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=242">Location 242</a>)</li>
<li>The Pulitzer Prize–winning historian David Hackett Fischer observed that questions “are the engines of intellect5—cerebral machines that convert curiosity into controlled inquiry.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=262">Location 262</a>)</li>
<li>So then, one of the primary drivers of questioning is an awareness of what we don’t know—which is a form of higher awareness that separates not only man from monkey but also the smart and curious person from the dullard who doesn’t know or care. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=280">Location 280</a>)</li>
<li>one of the keys to scientific discovery is the willingness of scientists to embrace ignorance—and to use questions as a means of navigating through it to new discoveries. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=287">Location 287</a>)</li>
<li>Answers, on the other hand, often end the process.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=289">Location 289</a>)</li>
<li>What we know about divergent thinking is that it mostly happens in the more creative right hemisphere of the brain; that it taps into imagination and often triggers random association of ideas (which is a primary source of creativity); and that it can be intellectually stimulating and rewarding. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=318">Location 318</a>)</li>
<li>Rothstein points out, however, that questions not only open up thinking—they also can direct and focus it. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=322">Location 322</a>)</li>
<li>they were humble enough to acknowledge a lack of knowledge, and confident enough to admit this in front of others. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=330">Location 330</a>)</li>
<li>That’s because with each new advance, Thrun said, one must pause to ask, Now that we know what we now know, what’s possible now? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=360">Location 360</a>)</li>
<li>business leaders sometimes find themselves thrust back into questioning mode during dire or dynamic times, when those rules and methods they’ve come to rely on no longer work. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=385">Location 385</a>)</li>
<li>With all that’s changing in the world and in our customers’ lives, what business are we really in? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=390">Location 390</a>)</li>
<li>“I have to reframe how I even think about using all of this technology. I find myself asking all kinds of fundamental questions. And as I do that, I eventually realize that the lenses I’m looking through to see the world around me are wrong—and that I have to construct a whole new frame of reference.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=466">Location 466</a>)</li>
<li>“the ability to evaluate risk, recognize demagoguery, the ability to question not only other people’s views, but one’s own assumptions.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=486">Location 486</a>)</li>
<li>Picasso was onto this truth fifty years ago when he commented, “Computers are useless—they only give31 you answers.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=491">Location 491</a>)</li>
<li>Einstein explains that there’s no reason to fill his mind with information that can so easily be looked up. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=515">Location 515</a>)</li>
<li>“If you don’t have that disposition to question,” Brown says, “you’re going to fear change. But if you’re comfortable questioning, experimenting, connecting things—then change is something that becomes an adventure. And if you can see it as an adventure, then you’re off and running.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=545">Location 545</a>)</li>
<li>We get these breakthroughs, Pogue writes, “when someone looks at the way things36 have always been done and asks why?” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=584">Location 584</a>)</li>
<li>(Basic formula: Q (questioning) + A (action) = I (innovation). On the other hand, Q – A = P (philosophy). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=616">Location 616</a>)</li>
<li>Person encounters a situation that is less than ideal; asks Why. •        Person begins to come up with ideas for possible improvements/solutions—with such ideas usually surfacing in the form of What If possibilities. •        Person takes one of those possibilities and tries to implement it or make it real; this mostly involves figuring out How. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=620">Location 620</a>)</li>
<li>this is the beauty of “process” in general: It may not provide any answers or solutions, but, as one design-thinker told me, having a process helps you to keep taking next steps—so that, as he put it, “even when you don’t know what41 you’re doing, you still know what to do.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=643">Location 643</a>)</li>
<li>(Epiphanies often are characterized as “Aha! moments,” but that suggests the problem has been solved in a flash. More often, insights arrive as What if moments—bright possibilities that are untested and open to question.) (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=658">Location 658</a>)</li>
<li>They often result from connecting existing ideas in unusual and interesting ways. Einstein was an early believer in this form of “combinatorial thinking”; today it is widely accepted as one of the primary sources of creativity. Since this type of thinking involves both connections and questions, I think of it as connective inquiry. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=668">Location 668</a>)

<li>Note: 我也经常想到这个,并很想做一个让庶民思考互联的笔记系统。可是我不确定人们是不是愿意共享自己引以为豪的想法。得继续想想。</li>

<li>What sets apart the innovative questioners is their ability—mostly born out of persistence and determination—to give form to their ideas and make them real. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=698">Location 698</a>)</li>
<li>The adult, in this case, becomes exasperated, insecure, aware of his own ignorance, and reminded of his insignificance—all because of that word why. As Louis C.K. makes clear, we may profess to admire kids’ curiosity, but at some point we just don’t welcome those questions anymore.

<li>Harris has described it as “a series of complex mental maneuvers.” It starts with knowing that you don’t know. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=773">Location 773</a>)</li>
<li>“Without the ability to conceive of more than one possible way that things might stand in the world, why ask a question?” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=776">Location 776</a>)</li>
<li>Lastly, it means children have figured out an efficient way to fill this gap in their knowledge—by asking someone who might know. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=777">Location 777</a>)</li>
<li>one of the desirable things they’re referring to is that state where you see things without labels, without categorization. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=793">Location 793</a>)</li>
<li>Most preschool environments are relatively unstructured and allow for more free-form play and exploration—which may be key to helping kids maintain their propensity to inquire and learn at this level. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=817">Location 817</a>)</li>
<li>the more preschool models itself after regular school—the more it becomes a venue for loading kids up with information and feeding them answers to questions they have not yet asked—the more it seems to squelch their natural curiosity.

<li>When we start teaching too much, too soon, says Gopnik, we’re inadvertently cutting off paths of inquiry and exploration that kids might otherwise pursue on their own. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=823">Location 823</a>)

<li>the consensus seems to be that this new world demands citizens who are self-learners; who are creative and resourceful; who can adjust and adapt to constant change. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=927">Location 927</a>)</li>
<li>Evidence: How do we know what’s true or false?

<li>“Fear is the enemy of curiosity. Unfortunately, if you’re in that situation, you may feel pressure to look a certain way to others.” That can cause students to act as if they already know or just don’t care.

<li>“Questions are used a lot in the classroom but it’s mostly one-way,” says Rothstein. “It’s not about the student asking, it’s about the teacher prompting the student by using questions that the teacher has formulated.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1153">Location 1153</a>)</li>
<li>They were instructed to change open questions to closed ones, and vice versa—so that, for example, an open question that began as Why is torture effective? might be changed to a closed one: Is torture effective?

<li>They feel it’s not enough to encourage students to toss out questions endlessly; to question effectively, they must learn how to analyze their own questions and zero in on ones they would like to pursue further.

<li>“The ‘ownership’ part of this is very important,” he said. “We’ve had kids say that when you ask your own question, you then feel like it’s your job to get the answer.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1194">Location 1194</a>)</li>
<li>Luz Santana knew from firsthand experience34 that those who don’t know how to ask the right questions are vulnerable to being denied that which they might need or are entitled to have.

<li>questioning is a more subtle and complex skill than many realize, involving three kinds of sophisticated thinking—divergent, convergent, and metacognitive. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1278">Location 1278</a>)</li>
<li>Since questioning seems to drop off at around age five, the innate questioning skills we start out with have long been neglected by junior high and high school. By that time, “the question-asking muscle,” as Rothstein calls it, has atrophied and needs to be built up. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1279">Location 1279</a>)</li>

<li>It’s about jumping through hoops, and mastering what’s on the test. There’s no time where students are asked to step back and think about what they’re doing—and why they’re doing it.

<li>his professor “was showing us that everything is open to question, especially the things we thought we already knew.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1313">Location 1313</a>)</li>
<li>Importantly, the professor was also “willing to ask questions without knowing the answer. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1314">Location 1314</a>)</li>
<li>students find it really liberating to have a teacher say, ‘I don’t know the answer—so let’s figure this out together.’” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1315">Location 1315</a>)</li>
<li>one of the interesting things Thrun is trying to do with Udacity is to bring the Socratic method to online teaching. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1323">Location 1323</a>)</li>
<li>Whether or not online courses provide an answer in and of themselves, they are part of a larger phenomenon in which more people of all ages are beginning to direct their own learning, exercising their questioning muscles—and doing so outside the established institutions of learning.

<li>Brown believes that young people may be honing better new-economy skills outside the classroom than in it; they’re learning to create, experiment, build, question, and learn. So it may turn out that in a world of exponential change, “these are the kids who will have the skills to rise to the top.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1345">Location 1345</a>)</li>
<li>“If you dream of something worth doing and then simply go to work on it . . . if you think of, detail by detail, what you have to do next, it is a wonderful dream even if the end is a long way off, for there are about five thousand steps to be taken before we realize it; and start making the first ten, and stay making twenty after, it is amazing how quickly you get through those five thousand steps.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1407">Location 1407</a>)</li>
<li>This underscores a point made earlier, that nonexperts or outsiders are often better at questioning than the experts. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1413">Location 1413</a>)

<li>By thinking of questioning and problem solving in a more structured way, we can remind ourselves to shift approaches, change tools, and adjust our questions according to which stage we’re entering.

<li>•        Step back. •        Notice what others miss. •        Challenge assumptions (including our own). •        Gain a deeper understanding of the situation or problem at hand, through contextual inquiry. •        Question the questions we’re asking. •        Take ownership of a particular question.

<li>The group needed to be challenged to “step back” by someone like Lois—who had a healthy enough ego to withstand being the lone questioner in the room. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1475">Location 1475</a>)</li>
<li>As everyday life becomes more jam-packed with tasks, activities, diversions, and distractions, “stepping back and questioning” is unlikely to get a slot on the schedule. Which means some of the most important questions—about why we’re engaging in all those activities in the first place—never get raised. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1487">Location 1487</a>)</li>
<li>So perhaps the first rule of asking why is that there must be a pause, a space, an interruption in the meeting, a halt of “progress,” a quiet moment looking out the window on the bus. Often, these are the only times when there is time to question. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1496">Location 1496</a>)</li>
<li>If asking Why requires stepping back from “doing,” it also demands a step back from “knowing.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1499">Location 1499</a>)</li>

<li>Part of the value in asking naïve questions, Bennett says, is that it forces people to explain things simply, which can help bring clarity to an otherwise complex issue. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1536">Location 1536</a>)</li>
<li>Sometimes, he says, his naïveté gives others permission to step back and rethink in ways they might not normally be comfortable doing. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1539">Location 1539</a>)</li>
<li>“Part of questioning is about exposing vulnerability—and being okay with vulnerability as a cultural currency.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1544">Location 1544</a>)</li>
<li>Zen principle known as shoshin, or “beginner’s mind.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1552">Location 1552</a>)</li>
<li>Suzuki writes, “The mind of the beginner is empty, free of the habits of the expert.” Such a mind, he added, is “open to all possibilities” and “can see things as they are.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1559">Location 1559</a>)</li>
<li>“In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1562">Location 1562</a>)</li>
<li>(one recent book coined the term Zennovation to describe the merging of Zen principles and innovation strategies). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1568">Location 1568</a>)</li>
<li>a Zen practitioner, says the key to adopting this manner of observing and questioning is to make an effort to become, in his word, “detached”—from everyday thoughts, distractions, preconceived notions, habitual behaviors, and even from oneself. “Basically, you begin to observe yourself as if you were a third party.” If you can achieve that sense of detachment, your thinking becomes more “flexible and fluid,” Komisar maintains, and “you find yourself in a better position to question everything.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1577">Location 1577</a>)</li>
<li>it’s actually easy for people to “think young,” with a little nudge. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1596">Location 1596</a>)</li>
<li>with more distance, a bigger picture comes into view. We may now be able to see the overall context; we might notice the patterns and relationships between things we’d previously thought of as separate.

<li>With déjà vu, you go somewhere you’ve never before been yet it seems oddly familiar; conversely, when you look at something familiar and suddenly see it fresh, this is a case of vuja de, to use a quirky term13 favored by Stanford University professor and author Bob Sutton. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1611">Location 1611</a>)</li>
<li>Sutton notes: “It means thinking of things that are usually assumed to be negative as positive, and vice versa. It can mean reversing assumptions about cause and effect, or what matters most versus least. It means not traveling through life on automatic pilot.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1618">Location 1618</a>)</li>
<li>he’d experienced vuja de, which, as he explained, was “the strange feeling that, somehow, none of this has ever happened before.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1626">Location 1626</a>)</li>
<li>Why do we do things the way we do them? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1634">Location 1634</a>)</li>
<li>When people fail to see what’s right in front of them, it’s often because “they stopped looking too soon.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1647">Location 1647</a>)</li>
<li>They study the small details; and they look for not only what’s there but what’s missing. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1676">Location 1676</a>)</li>
<li>“shifting our focus from objects or20 patterns in the foreground to those in the background.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1678">Location 1678</a>)</li>
<li>Einstein talked about looking for the needle in the haystack and finding it—at which point most people stop looking. The secret, he said, is to keep looking, in search of an even better needle.

<li>The idea that would eventually become Airbnb was challenging a basic assumption: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1707">Location 1707</a>)</li>
<li>Gebbia told me that part of the reason he and Chesky believed this was a problem worth solving—the reason, he suspects, that they saw what others missed—was that they had been on both sides of the problem. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1712">Location 1712</a>)</li>
<li>aggressively challenges assumptions about how our economy works, the extent to which people are willing to change ingrained behavior, and whether sharing even makes sense as a viable business model.

<li>How can we get those with money to pay more? The answer: The better the hospital you requested, the more you were charged for the ride. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1753">Location 1753</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Sidechain info</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Clearly, though, the success Gebbia and Chesky have already achieved is rooted in their willing-ness to challenge assumptions and to believe that everything is subject to change—regardless of what conventional wisdom holds. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1758">Location 1758</a>)</li>
<li>They have a certain attitude about them: restless, rebellious, skeptical of convention and authority. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1761">Location 1761</a>)</li>
<li>Asking challenger questions is inherently uncomfortable—“it creates dissonance,” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00GC53AG8&amp;location=1767">Location 1767</a>)</li>
