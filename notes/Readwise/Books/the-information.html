<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>“Theories permit consciousness to ‘jump over its own shadow,’ to leave behind the given, to represent the transcendent, yet, as is self-evident, only in symbols.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=101">Location 101</a>)</li>
<li>“What lies at the heart of every living thing is not a fire, not warm breath, not a ‘spark of life,’ ” declares the evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins. “It is information, words, instructions.… If you want to understand life, don’t think about vibrant, throbbing gels and oozes, think about information technology.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=138">Location 138</a>)</li>
<li>The gene has its cultural analog, too: the meme. In cultural evolution, a meme is a replicator and propagator—an idea, a fashion, a chain letter, or a conspiracy theory. On a bad day, a meme is a virus. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=146">Location 146</a>)</li>
<li>“What we call reality,” Wheeler wrote coyly, “arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions.” He added: “All things physical are information-theoretic in origin, and this is a participatory universe.” The whole universe is thus seen as a computer—a cosmic information-processing machine. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=164">Location 164</a>)</li>
<li>When photons and electrons and other particles interact, what are they really doing? Exchanging bits, transmitting quantum states, processing information. The laws of physics are the algorithms. Every burning star, every silent nebula, every particle leaving its ghostly trace in a cloud chamber is an information processor. The universe computes its own destiny. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=170">Location 170</a>)</li>
<li>In the long run, history is the story of information becoming aware of itself. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=200">Location 200</a>)</li>
<li>Redundancy—inefficient by definition—serves as the antidote to confusion. It provides second chances. Every natural language has redundancy built in; this is why people can understand text riddled with errors and why they can understand conversation in a noisy room. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=421">Location 421</a>)</li>
<li>The written word—the persistent word—was a prerequisite for conscious thought as we understand it. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=617">Location 617</a>)</li>
<li>“The larger the number of senses involved, the better the chance of transmitting a reliable copy of the sender’s mental state.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B004DEPHUC&amp;location=803">Location 803</a>)</li>
