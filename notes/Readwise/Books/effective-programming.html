<ul>
<li>I’d argue that the people who need to learn to code will be spurred on most of all by honesty, not religious faith in the truthiness of code as a universal good. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=82">Location 82</a>)</li>
<li>I don’t advocate learning to code for the sake of learning to code. What I advocate is shamelessly following your joy. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=120">Location 120</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: follow your heart</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Here’s a person who a) found an interesting problem, b) attempted to create a solution to the problem, which naturally c) led him to learning to code. And he loved it. This is how it’s supposed to work. I didn’t become a programmer because someone told me learning to code was important, I became a programmer because I wanted to change the rules of the video games I was playing, and learning to code was the only way to do that. Along the way, I too fell in love. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=141">Location 141</a>)</li>
<li>The difference between a tolerable programmer and a great programmer is not how many programming languages they know, and it’s not whether they prefer Python or Java. It’s whether they can communicate their ideas. By persuading other people, they get leverage. By writing clear comments and technical specs, they let other programmers understand their code, which means other programmers can use and work with their code instead of rewriting it. Absent this, their code is worthless. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=223">Location 223</a>)</li>
<li>It turns out that traditional carrot-and-stick incentives are only useful for repetitive, mechanical tasks. The minute you have to do anything even slightly complex that requires even a little problem solving without a clear solution or rules — those incentives not only don’t work, they make things worse!

<ul>
<li>Note: 利益驱动并不是万灵药</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“Larry Page responds”high correlation between speed and good decisions…There are good fast decisions but no good slow decisions”" (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=434">Location 434</a>)</li>
<li>if your feel your code is too complex to understand without comments, your code is probably just bad. Rewrite it until it doesn’t need comments any more. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=600">Location 600</a>)</li>
<li>Success is rarely determined by the quality of your ideas. But it is frequently determined by the quality of your execution. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=735">Location 735</a>)</li>
<li>If you want to pull your team up to a higher level of engineering, you need a leader, not an enforcer. The (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=1313">Location 1313</a>)</li>
<li>the most effective kind of technical leadership is leading by example. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=1352">Location 1352</a>)</li>
<li>“Love thy neighbor”, not “Pretend you love thy neighbor.” Don’t fool yourself. If you don’t really care about the people whom you lead, you’ll never succeed as their leader. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B008HUMTO0&amp;location=1364">Location 1364</a>)</li>
