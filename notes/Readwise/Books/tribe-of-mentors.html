<ul>
<li>The older I get, the more time I spend—as a percentage of each day—on crafting better questions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=225">Location 225</a>)</li>
<li>Life punishes the vague wish and rewards the specific ask. After all, conscious thinking is largely asking and answering questions in your own head. If you want confusion and heartache, ask vague questions. If you want uncommon clarity and results, ask uncommonly clear questions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=227">Location 227</a>)</li>
<li>Milan Kundera, author of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, has said that “The stupidity of people comes from having an answer for everything. The wisdom of the novel comes from having a question for everything.” Substitute “master learner” for “novel,” and you have my philosophy of life. Often, all that stands between you and what you want is a better set of questions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=230">Location 230</a>)</li>
<li>Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari Poor Charlie’s Almanack by Charlie Munger (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=268">Location 268</a>)</li>
<li>tim.blog/booklist (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=274">Location 274</a>)</li>
<li>a quote by Anaïs Nin, which I see every day: “Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.” It’s a short reminder that success can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations we are willing to have, and by the number of uncomfortable actions we are willing to take. The most fulfilled and effective people I know—world-famous creatives, billionaires, thought leaders, and more—look at their life’s journey as perhaps 25 percent finding themselves and 75 percent creating themselves. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=340">Location 340</a>)</li>
<li>That experience taught me to take agency in my own professional narratives, and that endings don’t have to be failures, especially when you choose to end a project or shut down a business. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=390">Location 390</a>)</li>
<li>the best things that ever happened to me came during the times when the shit hit the fan and I had nothing and nobody to help me. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=454">Location 454</a>)</li>
<li>The disease of our times is that we live on the surface. We’re like the Platte River, a mile wide and an inch deep. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=509">Location 509</a>)</li>
<li>Real work and real satisfaction come from the opposite of what the web provides. They come from going deep into something—the book you’re writing, the album, the movie—and staying there for a long, long time. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=512">Location 512</a>)</li>
<li>The Hero with a Thousand Faces by Joseph Campbell (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=593">Location 593</a>)</li>
<li>“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.” –Steve Jobs Co-founder and former CEO of Apple (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=640">Location 640</a>)</li>
<li>“What you seek is seeking you.” –Rumi 13th-century Persian poet and Sufi master (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=645">Location 645</a>)</li>
<li>“Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.” –Oscar Wilde Irish writer, author of The Picture of Dorian Gray (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=648">Location 648</a>)</li>
<li>The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel. I have read hundreds of personal development books, but this is the one that clearly showed me how to visualize, contemplate, and focus on what it was I truly wanted. It revealed to me that we only get what we desire most, and to apply myself with a laserlike focus upon a goal, task, or project. That in order to “have” you must “do,” and in order to “do” you must “be”—and this process is immediate. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=664">Location 664</a>)</li>
<li>From that moment, I decided that if I was going to succeed or fail, it was going to be up to me. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=688">Location 688</a>)</li>
<li>“God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.”—Ralph Waldo Emerson (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=690">Location 690</a>)</li>
<li>“I’d rather die doing something I feel is great and amazing rather than be safe and comfortable living a life I hate.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=694">Location 694</a>)</li>
<li>Intelligence is like following a GPS route right into a body of water until you drown. Wisdom looks at the route but, when it takes a turn into the ocean, decides not to follow it, then finds a new, better way. Wisdom reigns supreme. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=701">Location 701</a>)</li>
<li>The truth is that competition is the opposite of creativity. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=708">Location 708</a>)</li>
<li>This competitive mindset destroys people. It’s the scorched-earth way of thinking, and everyone is burned. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=711">Location 711</a>)</li>
<li>Creativity operates differently. You work hard because you’re inspired to, not because you have to. Work becomes fun, and you have energy for days because this life is not a “young man’s game.” It is an “inspired person’s game.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=713">Location 713</a>)</li>
<li>You won’t take a bullet for pleasure or power, but you will for meaning. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=728">Location 728</a>)</li>
<li>If we use busy as an excuse for not doing something what we are really, really saying is that it’s not a priority. Simply put: You don’t find the time to do something; you make the time to do things. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=766">Location 766</a>)</li>
<li>Instead, Dani declared that courage was more important than confidence. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=798">Location 798</a>)</li>
<li>No one cares if you are a people person. Have a point of view, and share it meaningfully, thoughtfully, and with conviction. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=815">Location 815</a>)</li>
<li>Suffering is a moment of clarity, when you can no longer deny the truth of a situation and are forced into uncomfortable change. I’m lucky that I didn’t get everything I wanted in my life, or I’d be happy with my first good job, my college sweetheart, my college town. Being poor when young led to making money when old. Losing faith in my bosses and elders made me independent and an adult. Almost getting into the wrong marriage helped me recognize and enter the right one. Falling sick made me focus on my health. It goes on and on. Inside suffering is the seed of change. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=845">Location 845</a>)</li>
<li>“Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=851">Location 851</a>)</li>
<li>It’s okay to have a desire. But pick a big one and pick it carefully. Drop the small ones. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=855">Location 855</a>)</li>
<li>Cultivate that desire by reading what you want, not what you’re “supposed to.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=859">Location 859</a>)</li>
<li>Follow your intellectual curiosity over whatever is “hot” right now. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=866">Location 866</a>)</li>
<li>Do everything you were going to do, but with less angst, less suffering, less emotion. Everything takes time. Ignore: The news. Complainers, angry people, high-conflict people. Anyone trying to scare you about a danger that isn’t clear and present. Don’t do things that you know are morally wrong. Not because someone is watching, but because you are. Self-esteem is just the reputation that you have with yourself. You’ll always know. Ignore the unfairness—there is no fair. Play the hand that you’re dealt to the best of your ability. People are highly consistent, so you will eventually get what you deserve and so will they. In the end, everyone gets the same judgment: death. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=868">Location 868</a>)</li>
<li>Memento mori—“remember that you have to die.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=881">Location 881</a>)</li>
<li>The Beggar King and the Secret of Happiness: A True Story by Joel ben Izzy. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=3062">Location 3062</a>)</li>
<li>“What makes a river so restful to people is that it doesn’t have any doubt—it is sure to get where it is going, and it doesn’t want to go anywhere else.”—Hal Boyle. There is so much going on in a day, actions and distractions, it’s easy to get caught up and lose your vision. This quote brings me right back to where I want to be. It keeps me grounded. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=3088">Location 3088</a>)</li>
<li>And those books are Zen in the Art of Archery by Eugen Herrigel, Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain by Betty Edwards, The Crack in the Cosmic Egg by Joseph Chilton Pearce, The Act of Creation by Arthur Koestler, and, perhaps most of all, The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind by Julian Jaynes. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=3112">Location 3112</a>)</li>
<li>heart rate variability training? HRV training?” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=3154">Location 3154</a>)</li>
<li>HeartMath Inner Balance biofeedback monitor. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B071KJ7PTB&amp;location=3171">Location 3171</a>)</li>
<li>“confirmation bias.” The information we gain that conflicts with our original assessment or conclusion, we conveniently ignore or dismiss, while the information that confirms our original decision makes us increasingly certain that our conclusion was correct.
