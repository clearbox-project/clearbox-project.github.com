<li>The trick, researchers say, is realizing that a prerequisite to motivation is believing we have authority over our actions and surroundings. To motivate ourselves, we must feel like we are in control. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Z3FRYB0&amp;location=290">Location 290</a>)</li>
<li>One way to prove to ourselves that we are in control is by making decisions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Z3FRYB0&amp;location=297">Location 297</a>)</li>
<li>Researchers have found that people with an internal locus of control tend to praise or blame themselves for success or failure, rather than assigning responsibility to things outside their influence. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Z3FRYB0&amp;location=358">Location 358</a>)</li>
<li>“Internal locus of control has been linked with academic success, higher self-motivation and social maturity, lower incidences of stress and depression, and longer life span,” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Z3FRYB0&amp;location=362">Location 362</a>)</li>
<li>People with an internal locus of control tend to earn more money, have more friends, stay married longer, and report greater professional success and satisfaction. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Z3FRYB0&amp;location=364">Location 364</a>)</li>
<li>We praise people for doing things that are hard. That’s how they learn to believe they can do them.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Z3FRYB0&amp;location=409">Location 409</a>)</li>
<li>We’re trying to teach them that you can’t just obey orders. You have to take control and figure things out for yourself.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Z3FRYB0&amp;location=444">Location 444</a>)</li>
<li>When things are at their most miserable, their drill instructors had said, they should ask each other questions that begin with “why.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00Z3FRYB0&amp;location=453">Location 453</a>)</li>
<li>If you can link something hard to a choice you care about, it makes the task easier, Quintanilla’s drill instructors had told him. That’s why they asked each other questions starting with “why.” Make a chore into a meaningful decision, and self-motivation will emerge.
