<ul>
<li>The kernel is software residing in memory that tells the CPU what to do. The kernel manages the hardware and acts primarily as an interface between the hardware and any running program. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00PKTGLWM&amp;location=456">Location 456</a>)</li>
<li>A CPU is just an operator on memory; it reads its instructions and data from the memory and writes data back out to the memory. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00PKTGLWM&amp;location=479">Location 479</a>)</li>
<li>One of the kernel’s tasks is to split memory into many subdivisions, and it must maintain certain state information about those subdivisions at all times. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00PKTGLWM&amp;location=490">Location 490</a>)</li>
<li>The kernel is in charge of managing tasks in four general system areas: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00PKTGLWM&amp;location=492">Location 492</a>)</li>
<li>Operating System Concepts, 9th edition, by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter B. Galvin, and Greg Gagne (Wiley, 2012) and Modern Operating Systems, 4th edition, by Andrew S. Tanenbaum and Herbert Bos (Prentice Hall, 2014). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00PKTGLWM&amp;location=502">Location 502</a>)</li>
<li>The kernel is responsible for context switching. To understand how this works, let’s think about a situation in which a process is running in user mode but its time slice is up. Here’s what happens: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00PKTGLWM&amp;location=518">Location 518</a>)</li>
<li>system designers constantly try to make root access as unnecessary as possible, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00PKTGLWM&amp;location=625">Location 625</a>)</li>
<li>The main difference between environment and shell variables is that the operating system passes all of your shell’s environment variables to programs that the shell runs, whereas shell variables cannot be accessed in the commands that you run.
