<ul>
<li>In the United States, the call for a China-centered history of China has led to a tendency to downplay the international aspects of China’s history. In China, one reason for this neglect is the bias against acknowledging foreign influences, except for negative ones.

<li>Although many scholars have seen this sense of Hong Kong identity as a relatively recent phenomenon, it took root in the late 1800s when the Chinese in Hong Kong contrasted the order and prosperity there against the political chaos and economic backwardness of China.

<li>The First Opium War ended officially with the Treaty of Nanking, signed on August 29, 1842. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00E2Q79NO&amp;location=349">Location 349</a>)</li>
<li>Most important, Britain’s global position depended on opium: Britain used the revenue from the opium trade to buy tea and silk from China and to support the occupation of India, Chinese merchants used the profits from tea and silk to buy opium from British traders, Indian producers used revenues from opium to buy British goods, and British merchants used the profits from selling British goods to buy cotton from the United States.

<li>Hong Kong’s economic recovery began in the early 1850s, when many Chinese merchants came to Hong Kong to escape the Taiping Rebellion. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00E2Q79NO&amp;location=633">Location 633</a>)</li>
