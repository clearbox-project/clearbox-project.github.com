<ul>
<li><ol>
<li>Compound yourself (Location 13)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote. (Location 23)</li>
<li><ol start="2">
<li>Have almost too much self-belief (Location 28)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. (Location 38)</li>
<li><ol start="3">
<li>Learn to think independently (Location 41)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You have to give yourself a lot of chances to get lucky. (Location 46)</li>
<li><ol start="4">
<li>Get good at “sales” (Location 48)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>All great careers, to some degree, become sales jobs. (Location 50)</li>
<li>The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling. (Location 53)</li>
<li><ol start="5">
<li>Make it easy to take risks (Location 58)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Once you’ve gotten yourself to a point where you have your basic obligations covered you should try to make it easy to take risks. (Location 61)</li>
<li>Look for small bets you can make where you lose 1x if you’re wrong but make 100x if it works. Then make a bigger bet in that direction. (Location 62)</li>
<li>It’s easy—and human nature—to prioritize short-term gain and convenience over long-term fulfillment. (Location 66)</li>
<li><ol start="6">
<li>Focus (Location 69)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. (Location 71)</li>
<li><ol start="7">
<li>Work hard (Location 73)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success. (Location 77)</li>
<li>work stamina seems to be one of the biggest predictors of long-term success. (Location 85)</li>
<li><ol start="8">
<li>Be bold (Location 88)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Follow your curiosity. Things that seem exciting to you will often seem exciting to other people too. (Location 93)</li>
<li>A big secret is that you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time—most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. (Location 94)</li>
<li><ol start="10">
<li>Be hard to compete with (Location 104)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields. There are many other strategies, but you have to figure out some way to do it. (Location 107)</li>
<li>Most people do whatever most people they hang out with do. This mimetic behavior is usually a mistake—if you’re doing the same thing everyone else is doing, you will not be hard to compete with. (Location 109)</li>
<li><ol start="11">
<li>Build a network (Location 111)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. (Location 113)</li>
<li>One of the best ways to build a network is to develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. (Location 115)</li>
<li>learn how to evaluate what people are great at, and put them in those roles. (Location 117)</li>
<li>You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out. (Location 118)</li>
<li>Everyone is better at some things than others. Define yourself by your strengths, not your weaknesses. Acknowledge your weaknesses and figure out how to work around them, but don’t let them stop you from doing what you want to do. (Location 119)</li>
<li>The best way to make up for your weaknesses is to hire complementary team members instead of just hiring people who are good at the same things you are. (Location 122)</li>
<li>A particularly valuable part of building a network is to get good at discovering undiscovered talent. (Location 123)
<ul>
<li>Note: 想起了Raymond Reddington</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The easiest way to learn is just to meet a lot of people, and keep track of who goes on to impress you and who doesn’t. Remember that you are mostly looking for rate of improvement, and don’t overvalue experience or current accomplishment. (Location 124)</li>
<li>I try to always ask myself when I meet someone new “is this person a force of nature?” It’s a pretty good heuristic for finding people who are likely to accomplish great things. (Location 126)</li>
<li>A special case of developing a network is finding someone eminent to take a bet on you, ideally early in your career. The best way to do this, no surprise, is to go out of your way to be helpful. (And remember that you have to pay this forward at some point later!) (Location 128)</li>
<li><ol start="12">
<li>You get rich by owning things (Location 130)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You get truly rich by owning things that increase rapidly in value. (Location 133)</li>
<li>But somehow or other, you need to own equity in something, instead of just selling your time. Time only scales linearly. (Location 134)</li>
<li>The best way to make things that increase rapidly in value is by making things people want at scale. (Location 135)</li>
<li>Most people are primarily externally driven; they do what they do because they want to impress other people. (Location 136)</li>
<li>The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. (Location 143)</li>
<li>This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone. The right motivations are hard to define a set of rules for, but you know it when you see it. (Location 146)</li>
<li>Jessica Livingston and Paul Graham (Location 147)</li>
<li>Eventually, you will define your success by performing excellent work in areas that are important to you. The sooner you can start off in that direction, the further you will be able to go. It is hard to be wildly successful at anything you aren’t obsessed with. (Location 150)</li>
