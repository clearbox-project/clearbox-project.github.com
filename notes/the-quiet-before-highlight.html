<li>the incubation of radical new ideas is a very distinct process with certain conditions: a tight space, lots of heat, passionate whispering, and a degree of freedom to argue and work toward a common, focused aim.

<li>Saul Alinsky, the community organizer whose Rules for Radicals became a bible for activists, wrote that successful revolutions follow the three-act structure of a play. “The first act introduces the characters and the plot, in the second act the plot and characters are developed as the play strives to hold the audience’s attention. In the final act good and evil have their dramatic confrontation and resolution.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0951PCX8L&amp;location=117">Location 117</a>)</li>
<li>The paradox, as Zeynep Tufekci described it in her book, Twitter and Tear Gas, is that the megaphone can bring “a full-blown moment of attention” to activists “when they have little or no shared history of facing challenges together.” The hard work of hammering out ideology and organizational structure, the building of a strong identity and the setting of goals, all of it can be leaped over, creating movements with all the depth and solidity of a raised-fist emoji.
