  <div class="content"><p>Key: aging is a disease, aging can be treated, and it's even might be easier than treating cancers.</p>

<p>lifespan vs health span</p>

<li>基因逻辑电路：基因A在艰苦时抑制繁衍，基因B在物资丰富的时候抑制基因A，在困难时期，基因B还会帮助修复DNA，从而确保繁衍后代的DNA是没有损坏的。

<li>Let’s call it Magna superstes. That’s Latin for “great survivor.”</li>
<li>由於違抗了繁殖的古老命令，M. superstes得以生存下來。</li>

<li>面对癌症我们曾束手无策，「这就是命」。（这部分可以在结尾时说，「而现在，衰老研究就相当于抗癌研究的1960s」）
<ul>
<li>七十年代分子生物学家Peter Vogt and Peter Duesberg发现了基因突变可能引发癌症基因，抗癌研究进入了新的范式。短短几十年，政治家就开始说在任期内消灭癌症。虽然这听起来荒诞，但专家们并没有说消灭癌症是不可能的。事实上在过去十年里出现的免疫疗法就颇具前途。自2011年以来，在BRAF抑制剂和免疫疗法的结合治疗下，黑色素瘤腦轉移這種最致命的癌症之一的存活率增加了91％。从1991年到2016年，美國的癌症總死亡人數下降了27％，且还在持續下降。</li>
<li>1960s那时候的癌症治疗方法还停留在对症状的缓解和压制，而如今，新治疗方案更接近治疗根本。</li>
<li>如生物学家 David Sinclair 所说 Aging research today is at a similar stage as cancer research was in the 1960s.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For centuries, beginning with Aristotle, scientists and philosophers have struggled to resolve this enigma. The Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius, for example, argued in his De Rerum Natura (On the Nature of Things) that aging and death are beneficial because they make room for the next generation (Bailey 1947), a view that persisted among biologists well into the 20th century. The famous 19th century German biologist, August Weissmann, for instance, suggested – similar to Lucretius – that selection might favor the evolution of a death mechanism that ensures species survival by making space for more youthful, reproductively prolific individuals (Weissmann 1891). But this explanation turns out to be wrong. </li>
</ul>

<p>Since the cost of death to individuals likely exceeds the benefit to the group or species, and because long-lived individuals leave more offspring than short-lived individuals (given equivalent reproductive output), selection would not favor such a death mechanism.</p>

<p>A more parsimonious evolutionary explanation for the existence of aging therefore requires an explanation that is based on individual fitness and selection, not on group selection. This was understood in the 1940's and 1950's by three evolutionary biologists, J.B.S. Haldane, Peter B. Medawar and George C. Williams, who realized that aging does not evolve for the "good of the species". Instead, they argued, aging evolves because natural selection becomes inefficient at maintaining function (and fitness) at old age. Their ideas were later mathematically formalized by William D. Hamilton and Brian Charlesworth in the 1960's and 1970's, and today they are empirically well supported. Below we review these major evolutionary insights and the empirical evidence for why we grow old and die.<br />
    - group selection -> individual selection -> disposable soma hypothesis -> except Homo sapiens<br />
- fundamental reason<br />
    - DNA damage hypothesis (1950s and 1960s)<br />
        - ‌Error catastrophe hypothesis<br />
        - Free radical theory of aging<br />
            - 抗氧化剂并没有延长寿命的作用（1970s and 1980s）<br />
            - 富含抗氧化剂的饮食能够产生积极的健康效果，更有可能是通过刺激身体对抗衰老的天然防御机制，包括增加身体消除自由基的酶的产生，而不是抗氧化活性本身的结果。<br />
        - Ironically, it was Szilard, in 1960, who initiated the demise of his own theory by figuring out to how to clone a human cell.18 Cloning gives us the answer as to whether or not mutations cause aging. If old cells had indeed lost crucial genetic information and this was the cause of aging, we shouldn’t be able to clone new animals from older individuals. Clones would be born old.<br />
        - 這些優秀的研究者的理論無法經得起時間的考驗，絕對不是一種恥辱。這正是大部分科學的命運，也許是所有科學的命運。在《科學革命的結構》中，湯瑪斯·库恩指出科學發現永遠不會完全，它會經歷可預測的演化階段。當一個理論成功地解釋了先前無法解釋的世界觀察時，它就成為科學家們可以用來發現更多的工具。<br />
            - 就像PG说的，学问以分形方式展开，从远处看，其边缘看起来平滑，但一旦你学得足够多，足够靠近，你会发现它们充满了缺口。<br />
    - hallmarks of aging causes aging and aging related diseases<br />
        - with the powerful computation power and automation advancing, research is progressing faster.  we can address the hallmarks to slow down or even stop aging. we might be able to extend the maximum limit (but this is unknown)<br />
        - but we again find ourselves in the period of chaos. we still don't know the cause of the hallmarks<br />
    - new understanding again emerged—aging is a loss of  information<br />
        - digital - DNA - computer<br />
        - analog - epigenetic - software<br />
            - The unlimited number of possible values is why many audiophiles still prefer the rich sounds of analog storage systems.<br />
            - Unlike digital, analog information degrades over time<br />
