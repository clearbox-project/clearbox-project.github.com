<li>Using three of the four factors turned back the clock about 57%, enough to make the mice youthful again. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq08b97vp0cvfmyqpxr44egt">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>“We’re not making stem cells, but turning back the clock so they can regain their identity,” says Sinclair. “I’ve been really surprised by how universally it works. We haven’t found a cell type yet that we can’t age forward and backward.” (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq08bm8avd96gpfrdt7w5mfb">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>This study is just the first step in redefining what it means to age, and Sinclair is the first to acknowledge that it raises more questions than answers. “We don’t understand how rejuvenation really works, but we know it works,” he says. “We can use it to rejuvenate parts of the body and hopefully make medicines that will be revolutionary. Now, when I see an older person, I don’t look at them as old, I just look at them as someone whose system needs to be rebooted. It’s no longer a question of if rejuvenation is possible, but a question of when.” (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gq08p4d4qvkry9sky4bf0nn6">View Highlight</a>)</li>
