<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>As you’ll see in this book, understanding memory is a key skill for programmers.</li>
<li>There have been court cases in which people convicted of drunk driving by breathalyzer have won the right to have the breathalyzer code reviewed. It turned out that the code was full of bugs, which resulted in overturned convictions. Recently, a piece of antivirus software crashed a piece of medical equipment in the middle of a heart surgery. Lives were lost due to design issues in the Boeing 737 MAX airplane. The large number of incidents like these don’t inspire a lot of confidence.</li>
<li>The likely goal of this initiative is not to produce great programmers but rather to increase software company profits by flooding the market with large numbers of poor programmers, which will drive down wages.

<li>Note: Shocking</li>
</ul></li>
<li>a recent study (“Gene Name Errors Are Widespread in the Scientific Literature” by Mark Ziemann, Yotam Eren, and Assam El-Osta) showed that one-fifth of published genetics papers have errors due to improper spreadsheet usage. Just think of the kinds of errors and ramifications that more powerful tools in the hands of more people could produce!</li>
<li>Flexibility and the ability to make inferences are skills that children learn as they grow up. But computers are like Peter Pan: they never grow up.</li>
<li>Consider a double major in electrical engineering and computer science if you want to rule the world.</li>
<li>An understanding of the core technology also leads to better solutions at higher levels. This isn’t just my opinion; check out the 2014 blog post “The Resource Leak Bug of Our Civilization” by Ville-Matias Heikkilä for a similar view.</li>
<li>The term bit is an awkward marriage between binary and digit.</li>
<li>Highlighted Image: Image</li>
<li>Few fundamental technologies were invented explicitly for computing; most were invented for other purposes and then adapted for computing.</li>
<li>This partitions the continuous space into discrete regions, which is what we want for stability and noise immunity—the ability to function in the presence of interference. You can think of analog as aiming for a big linear region and digital as wanting a small one</li>
<li>We take advantage of the transfer function’s toe and shoulder regions, called cutoff and saturation, respectively, in electrical engineering language</li>
<li>In fact, the term bug was popularized by American computer scientist Grace Hopper in 1947 when an error in the Harvard Mark II computer was traced to a moth trapped in a relay.</li>
<li>A contraction of transfer resistor, a transistor is similar to a vacuum tube but uses a special type of material, called a semiconductor, that can change between being a conductor and being an insulator.</li>
<li>When you hear about people overclocking their computers, it means they’re gambling that their part was statistically in the middle of its bin and that its clock can be increased by some amount without causing the part to fail.</li>
<li>You could build a version of this that has active high inputs by using NOR gates, but NOR gates are often more power-hungry than NAND gates, in addition to being more complicated and expensive to build.</li>
