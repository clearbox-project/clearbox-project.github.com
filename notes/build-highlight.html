<ul>
<li>I tried to build the iPhone twice. Everybody knows about the second time. The time we succeeded. Few people know about the first. (Location 180)</li>
<li>This insanely prophetic vision was made more completely nuts by the fact that this was—I repeat—1989. (Location 189)</li>
<li>Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit less. (Location 222)</li>
<li>when you’re looking at the array of potential careers before you, the correct place to start is this: “What do I want to learn?” (Location 227)</li>
<li>“The only failure in your twenties is inaction. The rest is trial and error.” —ANONYMOUS (Location 257)</li>
<li>Do, fail, learn. (Location 261)</li>
<li>you can’t skip a step—you can’t just have the answers handed to you and detour around the hard stuff. Humans learn through productive struggle, by trying it themselves and screwing up and doing it differently next time. In early adulthood you have to learn to embrace that—to know that the risks might not pan out but to take them anyway. You can get guidance and advice, you can choose a path by following someone else’s example, but you won’t really learn until you start walking down that path yourself and seeing where it takes you. (Location 263)</li>
<li>Your parents will always have suggestions for you—feel free to take them or ignore them. (Location 282)</li>
<li>Then the launch got delayed. Again. And again. And again. (Location 321)
<ul>
<li>Note: Release Early and get feedback as soon and much as possible</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When things started to go awry, I’d ventured out and started talking to people in sales and marketing, began learning about psychographics and branding, finally grasped the importance of managers, of process, of limits. After four years, I realized there was a whole world of thinking that was needed before a line of code should be written. (Location 341)</li>
<li>General Magic was making incredible technology but wasn’t making a product that would solve real people’s problems. (Location 345)</li>
<li>That’s what you’re looking for when you’re young, when you think you know everything then suddenly realize you have no idea what you’re doing: a place where you can work as hard as you can to learn as much as you can from people who can make something great. So even if the experience kicks your ass, the force of that kick will propel you into a new stage of your life. And you’ll figure out what to do next. (Location 346)</li>
<li>If you’re going to throw your time, energy, and youth at a company, try to join one that’s not just making a better mousetrap. Find a business that’s starting a revolution. (Location 351)</li>
<li>A company that’s likely to make a substantial change in the status quo has the following characteristics: It’s creating a product or service that’s wholly new or combines existing technology in a novel way that the competition can’t make or even understand. This product solves a problem—a real pain point—that a lot of customers experience daily. There should be an existing large market. The novel technology can deliver on the company vision—not just within the product but also the infrastructure, platforms, and systems that support it. Leadership is not dogmatic about what the solution looks like and is willing to adapt to their customers’ needs. It’s thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you’ve never heard before, but which makes perfect sense once you hear it. (Location 352)</li>
<li>Many people don’t have either a good gut instinct to follow or the faith in themselves to follow it. It takes time to develop that trust. So they try to turn an opinion-driven business decision into a data-driven one. But data can’t solve an opinion-based problem. So no matter how much data you get, it will always be inconclusive. This leads to analysis paralysis—death by overthinking. (Location 899)</li>
<li>People just can’t articulate what they want clearly enough to definitely point in one direction or another, especially if they’re considering something completely new that they’ve never used before. (Location 923)</li>
<li>A/B and user testing is not product design. It’s a tool. A test. At best, a diagnosis. It can tell you something’s not working, but it won’t tell you how to fix it. Or it can show you an option that solves one hyperlocal issue but breaks something else downstream. (Location 937)</li>
<li>I follow my curiosity and my passion. Always. (Location 1205)</li>
<li>Meet some new human beings. Networking is something you should be doing constantly—even when you’re happily employed. (Location 1218)</li>
<li>People won’t remember how you started. They’ll remember how you left. (Location 1240)</li>
<li>So if something’s not working, don’t just complain to people who have no power to fix it, then throw up your hands and quit. Even talking to your manager isn’t enough. Especially if it’s your manager that’s the problem. (Location 1250)</li>
<li>Too many people jump ship the second they need to dig in and really push through the hard, grinding work of making something real. (Location 1286)</li>
<li>Quit and go do something you’ll love. (Location 1329)</li>
<li>2001—ten months from when I started—the iPod emerged into the world, our fat plastic-and-stainless-steel baby. (Location 1399)</li>
<li>Apple is where I learned where to draw the line—is it done enough? Is it good enough? It’s where I learned the real meaning of design. And it’s where I learned to organize my brain and my team in the face of intense, grinding, never-ending pressure. (Location 1412)</li>
<li>when you’re creating a new product, regardless of whether it’s made of atoms or electrons, for businesses or consumers, the actual thing you’re building is only one tiny part of a vast, intangible, overlooked user journey that starts long before a customer ever gets their hands on your product and ends long after. (Location 1420)</li>
<li>Prototype as much of the full customer experience as possible. Make the intangible tangible so you can’t overlook the less showy but incredibly important parts of the journey. You should be able to map out and visualize exactly how a customer discovers, considers, installs, uses, fixes, and even returns your product. (Location 1424)</li>
<li>“How can you solve your problem without this?” (Location 1436)</li>
<li>The only time hardware is worth the headache of manufacturing and packaging and shipping is if it’s critically necessary and transformative. If hardware doesn’t absolutely need to exist to enable the overall experience, then it should not exist. (Location 1440)</li>
<li>“Don’t tell me what’s so special about this object. Tell me what’s different about the customer journey.” (Location 1443)</li>
<li>(Location 1447)</li>
<li>Too often makers only think of the user experience as that moment when the customer touches an object or taps a screen. (Location 1453)</li>
<li>But we weren’t paying enough attention to what was probably the most important part of the customer experience: the app on your phone. (Location 1458)</li>
<li>Start from that very first moment of the customer journey. You should be prototyping your marketing long before you have anything to market. (Location 1490)</li>
<li>A good product story has three elements: »  It appeals to people’s rational and emotional sides. »  It takes complicated concepts and makes them simple. » It reminds people of the problem that’s being solved—it focuses on the “why.” (Location 1573)</li>
<li>That “why” is the most critical part of product development—it has to come first. Once you have a strong answer for why your product is needed, then you can focus on how it works. (Location 1576)</li>
<li>The story of your product, your company, and your vision should drive everything you do. (Location 1582)</li>
<li>He used a technique I later came to call the virus of doubt. It’s a way to get into people’s heads, remind them about a daily frustration, get them annoyed about it all over again. If you can infect them with the virus of doubt—“Maybe my experience isn’t as good as I thought, maybe it could be better”—then you prime them for your solution. You get them angry about how it works now so they can get excited about a new way of doing things. (Location 1602)</li>
<li>Steve didn’t just read a script for the presentation. He’d been telling a version of that same story every single day for months and months during development—to us, to his friends, his family. He was constantly working on it, refining it. Every time he’d get a puzzled look or a request for clarification from his unwitting early audience, he’d sand it down, tweak it slightly, until it was perfectly polished. It was the story of the product. And it drove what we built. (Location 1611)</li>
<li>And when I say “story,” I don’t just mean words. Your product’s story is its design, its features, images and videos, quotes from customers, tips from reviewers, conversations with support agents. It’s the sum of what people see and feel about this thing that you’ve created. (Location 1618)</li>
<li>Why does this thing need to exist? Why does it matter? Why will people need it? Why will they love it? (Location 1625)</li>
<li>When you get wrapped up in the “what,” you get ahead of people. You think everyone can see what you see. But they don’t. (Location 1631)</li>
<li>There’s a competition for market share and a competition for mind share. (Location 1635)</li>
<li>why they need one version of lubricant over the other or give them information they never had before. (Location 1641)</li>
<li>You can earn their trust by showing that you really know your stuff or understand their needs. (Location 1642)</li>
<li>A good story is an act of empathy. It recognizes the needs of its audience. And it blends facts and feelings so the customer gets enough of both. First you need enough insights and concrete information that your argument doesn’t feel too floaty and insubstantial. It doesn’t have to be definitive data, but there has to be enough to feel meaty, to convince people that you’re anchored in real facts. But you can overdo it—if your story is only informational, then it’s entirely possible that people will agree with you but decide it’s not compelling enough to act on just yet. (Location 1644)</li>
<li>So you have to appeal to their emotions—connect with something they care about. Their worries, their fears. Or show them a compelling vision of the future: give a human example. Walk through how a real person will experience this product—their day, their family, their work, the change they’ll experience. (Location 1649)
<ul>
<li>Note: i was think how would i use my app. I realized that it would still be better if i read from handheld like iPad.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Just don’t lean so far into the emotional connection that what you’re arguing for feels novel, but not necessary. (Location 1651)</li>
<li>That’s why analogies can be such a useful tool in storytelling. They create a shorthand for complicated concepts—a bridge directly to a common experience. That’s another thing I learned from Steve Jobs. He’d always say that analogies give customers superpowers. (Location 1657)</li>
<li>Disruption makes enemies. (Location 1730)</li>
<li>You’re trying to change things, and change is scary, especially to people who think they’ve mastered their domain and who are completely unprepared for the ground to shift under their feet. (Location 1731)</li>
<li>We had to disrupt ourselves. (Location 1795)</li>
<li>And then there was the qualitative test: Did it feel good? Did I want to use it? Did it drive me crazy? (Location 1929)</li>
<li>This was an opinion-driven decision and Steve’s opinion was the one that counted most. “So either get on board right now or you’re off the team,” Steve said. That settled it for marketing. (Location 1934)</li>
<li>The lesson is about when and how vision and data should guide your decisions. In the very beginning, before there are customers, vision is more important than pretty much anything else. (Location 1961)</li>
<li>At that point you have to go back and, as painful as it is, honestly and thoroughly analyze why you failed. This is the moment when you need to gather data. Your gut got you to this point, so find data to help you understand why your gut was wrong. (Location 1970)</li>
<li>Typically your vision is so much greater than what materializes in V1. (Location 1983)</li>
<li>Here’s the trick: write a press release. But don’t write it when you’re done. Write it when you start. I began doing this at Apple and eventually realized other leaders had figured it out, too (looking at you, Bezos). It’s an incredibly useful tool to narrow down what really matters. (Location 1985)</li>
<li>To write a good press release you have to focus. The press release is meant to hook people—it’s how you get journalists interested in what you’re making. You have to catch their attention. You have to be succinct and interesting, highlight the most important and essential things that your product can do. You can’t just list everything you want to make—you have to prioritize. When you write a press release you say, “Here. This. This is what’s newsworthy. This is what really matters.” (Location 1988)</li>
<li>If you launched right now, could you more or less send that press release into the world and have it be mostly true? If the answer is yes, then congratulations: your product is probably ready, or at least pretty close. You have achieved the core of your vision. Everything else is most likely a “nice to have,” not a priority. (Location 1995)</li>
<li>You need constraints to make good decisions and the best constraint in the world is time. When you’re handcuffed to a hard deadline, you can’t keep trying this and that, changing your mind, putting the finishing touches on something that will never be finished. (Location 2003)</li>
<li>The external heartbeat, the constraint, drives the creativity, which fuels the innovation. (Location 2007)</li>
<li>Before you launch V1, your external deadline is always a little wobbly. There are too many unknown unknowns to write it in stone. So the way you keep everyone moving is by creating strong internal deadlines—heartbeats that your team sets their calendar to: 1. Team heartbeats: Each individual team makes its own rhythm and deadlines for delivering their piece of the puzzle. Then all the teams align for . . . 2. Project heartbeats: These are the moments when different teams sync to make sure the product still makes sense and all the pieces are moving at the right pace. (Location 2008)</li>
<li>we would have never reached that third design if we hadn’t given ourselves hard deadlines with the first two—if we hadn’t cut ourselves off after a few months, reset, and moved on. We forced as many constraints on ourselves as possible: not too much time, not too much money, and not too many people on the team. That last point is important. (Location 2045)</li>
<li>So keep your project small as long as you can. And don’t allocate too much money at the start. People do stupid things when they have a giant budget—they overdesign, they overthink. (Location 2059)</li>
<li>Generally any brand-new product should never take longer than 18 months to ship—24 at the limit. The sweet spot is somewhere between 9 and 18 months. That applies to hardware and software, atoms and bits. (Location 2061)</li>
<li>This rhythm is made of major milestones—board meetings, all-hands meetings, or project milestones at certain moments of product development where everyone, engineering and marketing and sales and support, can pause and sync with each other. (Location 2067)</li>
