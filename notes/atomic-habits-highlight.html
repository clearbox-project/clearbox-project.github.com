<ul>
<li>While my peers stayed up late and played video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my first year. (Location 120)</li>
<li>The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great book, you must first become the book.” (Location 161)</li>
<li>simply to develop into a responsible adult. (Location 164)</li>
<li>The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine, reward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. (Location 172)</li>
<li>What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. (Location 199)</li>
<li>Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat. (Location 258)</li>
<li>Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. (Location 263)</li>
<li>The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. (Location 270)

<li>Note: PI 我曾经觉得只要我知道怎么做就好,从没有想过将过脑子的事务变成本能。</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. (Location 273)</li>
<li>People reflect your behavior back to you. (Location 275)</li>
<li>Negative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere. (Location 281)
<ul>
<li>Note: 我有这个倾向,一定要注意</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. (Location 298)

<li>in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential. (Location 301)</li>
<li>Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees. (Location 305)</li>
<li>When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. (Location 306)</li>
<li>Mastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.” (Location 311)</li>
<li>FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD (Location 325)</li>
<li>The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. (Location 342)</li>
<li>What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. (Location 358)</li>
<li>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. (Location 374)</li>
<li>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. (Location 396)</li>
<li>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. (Location 405)</li>
<li>The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level. (Location 415)</li>
<li>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. (Location 417)</li>
<li>With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become. (Location 426)</li>
<li>Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. (Location 435)</li>
<li>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. (Location 452)</li>
<li>Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are. (Location 460)</li>
<li>Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. (Location 465)</li>
<li>When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. (Location 479)</li>
<li>Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. (Location 486)</li>
<li>In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” (Location 496)</li>
<li>The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it. (Location 501)</li>
<li>Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. (Location 517)</li>
<li>It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. (Location 529)</li>
<li>The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome. (Location 550)</li>
<li>Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone. Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits. (Location 559)</li>
<li>Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. (Location 566)</li>
<li>Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. (Location 567)</li>
<li>“behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” (Location 588)</li>
<li>This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming. (Location 601)</li>
<li>As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.” (Location 603)</li>
<li>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. (Location 610)</li>
<li>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. (Location 612)
<ul>
<li>Note: Limited resource leads to the way the brain works. I wonder what if we can use AI for most of the "habit" tasks. Probably a good startup idea.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks. (Location 615)</li>
<li>when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future. (Location 625)</li>
<li>cue, craving, response, and reward.* (Location 628)</li>
<li>Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.) (Location 634)</li>
<li>What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. (Location 639)</li>
<li>Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. (Location 641)</li>
<li>Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving. (Location 645)</li>
<li>The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. (Location 646)</li>
<li>Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. (Location 647)</li>
<li>Your response also depends on your ability. (Location 648)</li>
<li>Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us. (Location 651)</li>
<li>The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. (Location 652)</li>
<li>Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. (Location 656)</li>
<li>Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle. (Location 658)</li>
<li>If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated. (Location 659)</li>
<li>After decades of mental programming, we automatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting. (Location 727)</li>
<li>The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. (Location 760)</li>
<li>The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying. (Location 762)</li>
<li>The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across. (Location 786)</li>
<li>your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have. (Location 791)</li>
<li>This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful. (Location 798)</li>
<li>As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” (Location 815)</li>
<li>My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential items in her packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got my glasses. I’ve got my husband.” (Location 828)
<ul>
<li>Note: 跟办办一样!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness. (Location 832)</li>
<li>Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].” (Location 897)</li>
<li>The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit. (Location 901)</li>
<li>the two most common cues are time and location. (Location 904)</li>
<li>Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” (Location 905)</li>
<li>The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. (Location 913)</li>
<li>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. (Location 918)</li>
<li>The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. (Location 922)</li>
<li>The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. (Location 951)</li>
<li>When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. (Location 958)</li>
<li>Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. (Location 960)</li>
<li>The habit stacking formula is: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” (Location 962)</li>
<li>The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear plan for when and where to take action. (Location 1032)</li>
<li>In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E). (Location 1064)</li>
<li>In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words, customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them but because of how they are presented to them. (Location 1066)</li>
<li>The truth, however, is that many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option. (Location 1075)</li>
<li>The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision. (Location 1083)</li>
<li>For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead to a big shift in what you do. (Location 1086)</li>
<li>Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out. (Location 1095)</li>
<li>In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a fly near the center of each urinal. (Location 1100)</li>
<li>If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. (Location 1114)</li>
<li>Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. (Location 1119)</li>
<li>The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. (Location 1123)</li>
<li>Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. (Location 1130)</li>
<li>You can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. (Location 1133)</li>
<li>The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment. (Location 1138)</li>
<li>The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.” (Location 1149)</li>
<li>If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable. (Location 1166)</li>
<li>The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy behavior as a moral weakness. (Location 1195)</li>
<li>Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. (Location 1199)</li>
<li>the way to improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more disciplined environment. (Location 1203)</li>
<li>Showing pictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. (Location 1211)</li>
<li>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. (Location 1212)</li>
<li>Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it. (Location 1216)</li>
<li>Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. (Location 1220)</li>
<li>This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. (Location 1233)</li>
<li>Scientists refer to these exaggerated cues as supernormal stimuli. (Location 1294)</li>
<li>The modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. (Location 1315)</li>
<li>Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine.* (Location 1331)</li>
<li>For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes, including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion, and voluntary movement. (Location 1345)</li>
<li>When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. (Location 1347)</li>
<li>It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. (Location 1350)</li>
<li>The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response. (Location 1369)</li>
<li>Temptation bundling works by linking an action you want to do with an action you need to do. (Location 1379)</li>
<li>Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.” (Location 1394)</li>
<li>“The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.”* (Location 1451)</li>
<li>In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rules that guide your behavior each day. You’re always keeping them in mind, even if they are at the not top of your mind. Often, you follow the habits of your culture without thinking, without questioning, and sometimes without remembering. As the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices of life in society sweep us along.” (Location 1457)</li>
<li>We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close. The many. The powerful. (Location 1464)</li>
<li>Proximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true of the social environment. (Location 1468)</li>
<li>As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we are to imitate some of their habits. (Location 1474)</li>
<li>One groundbreaking study tracked twelve thousand people for thirty-two years and found that “a person’s chances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a friend who became obese.” It works the other way, too. Another study found that if one person in a relationship lost weight, the other partner would also slim down about one third of the time. (Location 1475)
<ul>
<li>Note: Interesting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. (Location 1483)</li>
<li>Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. (Location 1488)</li>
<li>Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a personal quest into a shared one. (Location 1493)</li>
<li>The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity. (Location 1496)</li>
<li>But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. (Location 1521)</li>
<li>When changing your habits means challenging the tribe, change is unattractive. When changing your habits means fitting in with the tribe, change is very attractive. (Location 1529)</li>
<li>We are drawn to behaviors that earn us respect, approval, admiration, and status. (Location 1534)</li>
<li>a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive. (Location 1540)</li>
<li>The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. (Location 1555)</li>
<li>The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history. (Location 1603)</li>
<li>Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address the same underlying motive. (Location 1603)</li>
<li>Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods you learned to use. Once you associate a solution with the problem you need to solve, you keep coming back to it. (Location 1605)</li>
<li>Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. (Location 1607)</li>
<li>You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment. (Location 1615)</li>
<li>A craving is the sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state. (Location 1625)</li>
<li>This gap between your current state and your desired state provides a reason to act. (Location 1626)</li>
<li>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. (Location 1627)</li>
<li>Neurologists have discovered that when emotions and feelings are impaired, we actually lose the ability to make decisions. We have no signal of what to pursue and what to avoid. As the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio explains, “It is emotion that allows you to mark things as good, bad, or indifferent.” (Location 1631)</li>
<li>To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. Whenever a habit successfully addresses a motive, you develop a craving to do it again. In time, you learn to predict that checking social media will help you feel loved or that watching YouTube will allow you to forget your fears. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings, and we can use this insight to our advantage rather than to our detriment. (Location 1633)</li>
<li>Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. (Location 1638)</li>
<li>I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn’t for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day. (Location 1644)</li>
<li>Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive. (Location 1647)</li>
<li>“It’s time to build endurance and get fast.” (Location 1650)</li>
<li>“I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate.” (Location 1659)</li>
<li>you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating your habits with something you enjoy, then you can use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation. (Location 1661)</li>
<li>You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath—and then create a short routine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love. (Location 1671)</li>
<li>Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. (Location 1675)</li>
<li>At the end of the term, he was surprised to find that all the best photos were produced by the quantity group. During the semester, these students were busy taking photos, experimenting with composition and lighting, testing out various methods in the darkroom, and learning from their mistakes. In the process of creating hundreds of photos, they honed their skills. Meanwhile, the quality group sat around speculating about perfection. In the end, they had little to show for their efforts other than unverified theories and one mediocre photo.* (Location 1722)
<ul>
<li>Note: Powerful idea</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.” (Location 1728)</li>
<li>I refer to this as the difference between being in motion and taking action. The two ideas sound similar, but they’re not the same. When you’re in motion, you’re planning and strategizing and learning. Those are all good things, but they don’t produce a result. (Location 1729)</li>
<li>motion allows us to feel like we’re making progress without running the risk of failure. (Location 1737)</li>
<li>that’s the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure. (Location 1738)</li>
<li>If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. (Location 1744)</li>
<li>Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity. Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. With each repetition, cell-to-cell signaling improves and the neural connections tighten. First described by neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.” (Location 1746)</li>
<li>In 1860, the English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.” Both common sense and scientific evidence agree: repetition is a form of change. (Location 1759)</li>
<li>All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over. (Location 1766)</li>
<li>The shape of these charts, which scientists call learning curves, reveals an important truth about behavior change: habits form based on frequency, not time. (Location 1774)</li>
<li>To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective way to make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it easy. (Location 1787)</li>
<li>IN HIS AWARD-WINNING BOOK, Guns, Germs, and Steel, anthropologist and biologist Jared Diamond points out a simple fact: different continents have different shapes. (Location 1797)
<ul>
<li>Note: The following points are very interesting</li>
</ul></li>
<li>our real motivation is to be lazy and to do what is convenient. (Location 1820)</li>
<li>Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.* (Location 1821)</li>
<li>The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run. (Location 1840)</li>
<li>One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment design as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions easier. (Location 1848)</li>
<li>The central idea is to create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Much of the battle of building better habits comes down to finding ways to reduce the friction associated with our good habits and increase the friction associated with our bad ones. (Location 1879)</li>
<li>Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy. (Location 1890)</li>
<li>“How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” (Location 1917)</li>
<li>Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit. (Location 1938)</li>
<li>Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. (Location 1941)</li>
<li>Decisive moments set the options available to your future self. (Location 1955)</li>
<li>Habits are the entry point, not the end point. (Location 1961)</li>
<li>But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. (Location 1997)</li>
<li>The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. (Location 2001)</li>
<li>The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said. (Location 2016)</li>
<li>It’s better to do less than you hoped than to do nothing at all. (Location 2024)
<ul>
<li>Note: Powerful idea</li>

<li>once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. (Location 2024)</li>
<li>The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” (Location 2057)</li>
<li>Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change: make it difficult. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device. (Location 2069)</li>
<li>The key is to change the task such that it requires more work to get out of the good habit than to get started on it. (Location 2083)</li>
<li>The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. (Location 2102)</li>
<li>When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.” (Location 2141)</li>
<li>Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did actually have the motivation to work on more meaningful tasks. After I removed the mental candy from my environment, it became much easier to eat the healthy stuff. (Location 2160)</li>
<li>make it satisfying. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. (Location 2239)</li>
<li>Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating. (Location 2241)</li>
<li>What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. (Location 2254)</li>
<li>The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop. (Location 2256)</li>
<li>But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction. (Location 2259)</li>
<li>immediate-return environment (Location 2263)</li>
<li>delayed-return environment (Location 2266)</li>
<li>The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. (Location 2267)</li>
<li>Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.* (Location 2278)</li>
<li>the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate. (Location 2283)</li>
<li>Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. (Location 2286)</li>
<li>The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.” (Location 2288)</li>
<li>Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future. (Location 2290)</li>
<li>As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals.* (Location 2296)</li>
<li>What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. (Location 2298)</li>
<li>If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded. (Location 2301)</li>
<li>At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward. (Location 2306)</li>
<li>What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. (Location 2317)</li>
<li>Habit stacking, which we covered in Chapter 5, ties your habit to an immediate cue, which makes it obvious when to start. Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying when you finish. (Location 2320)</li>
<li>You want to make avoidance visible. (Location 2325)</li>
<li>It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. (Location 2331)</li>
<li>Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. (Location 2340)</li>
<li>In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. (Location 2342)</li>
<li>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity. (Location 2366)</li>
<li>“Don’t break the chain” is a powerful mantra. (Location 2379)</li>
<li>Habit tracking is powerful because it leverages multiple Laws of Behavior Change. It simultaneously makes a behavior obvious, attractive, and satisfying. (Location 2381)</li>
<li>Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. (Location 2388)</li>
<li>manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. (Location 2418)</li>
<li>The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT]. (Location 2421)</li>
<li>simple rule: never miss twice. (Location 2432)</li>
<li>The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. (Location 2435)</li>
<li>we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. (Location 2440)</li>
<li>You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. (Location 2441)</li>
<li>As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” (Location 2443)</li>
<li>Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity. (Location 2448)</li>
<li>If your success is measured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower number on the scale, (Location 2459)</li>
<li>This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system. (Location 2464)</li>
<li>just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all. (Location 2468)</li>
<li>If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. (Location 2495)</li>
<li>Pain is an effective teacher. (Location 2502)</li>
<li>The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior. If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds. (Location 2506)</li>
<li>The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. There can’t be a gap between the action and the consequences. (Location 2508)</li>
<li>If you’re going to rely on punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To be productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise. (Location 2512)</li>
<li>In general, the more local, tangible, concrete, and immediate the consequence, the more likely it is to influence individual behavior. The more global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to influence individual behavior. (Location 2516)</li>
<li>Laws and regulations are an example of how government can change our habits by creating a social contract. (Location 2524)</li>
<li>Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. (Location 2527)</li>
<li>Our environment determines the suitability of our genes and the utility of our natural talents. When our environment changes, so do the qualities that determine success. (Location 2641)</li>
<li>Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick. This is the core idea behind the 4th Law. (Location 2686)</li>
<li>Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. (Location 2693)
<ul>
<li>Note: Reminds me the career planning and personality tests</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore. (Location 2704)</li>
<li>In the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. (Location 2706)</li>
<li>What feels like fun to me, but work to others? (Location 2713)</li>
<li>whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people. (Location 2714)</li>
<li>What makes me lose track of time? (Location 2716)</li>
<li>Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (Location 2719)</li>
<li>What comes naturally to me? (Location 2722)</li>
<li>Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction. (Location 2725)</li>
<li>When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses. (Location 2734)</li>
<li>Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you. (Location 2741)</li>
<li>Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor. (Location 2744)</li>
<li>Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. (Location 2747)</li>
<li>People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them. (Location 2752)</li>
<li>In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy. (Location 2755)</li>
<li>one of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.” (Location 2789)</li>
<li>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right. (Location 2796)</li>
<li>When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect. (Location 2804)</li>
<li>Once a habit has been established, however, it’s important to continue to advance in small ways. (Location 2806)</li>
<li>They found that to achieve a state of flow, a task must be roughly 4 percent beyond your current ability. (Location 2809)</li>
<li>Behaviors need to remain novel in order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored. And boredom is perhaps the greatest villain on the quest for self-improvement. (Location 2813)</li>
<li>“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?” He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.” (Location 2817)</li>
<li>this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. (Location 2823)</li>
<li>The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty. Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.” (Location 2828)</li>
<li>This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation. Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom. (Location 2837)</li>
<li>The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure. (Location 2840)</li>
<li>At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom. (Location 2847)</li>
<li>if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results. (Location 2849)</li>
<li>Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life. (Location 2854)</li>
<li>When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood. Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. (Location 2857)</li>
<li>Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. (Location 2868)</li>
<li>HABITS CREATE THE FOUNDATION FOR MASTERY. (Location 2871)</li>
<li>as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. (Location 2877)</li>
<li>The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. (Location 2878)</li>
<li>some research has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time. (Location 2881)</li>
<li>Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. (Location 2886)</li>
<li>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery (Location 2887)</li>
<li>Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. (Location 2891)</li>
<li>The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized. (Location 2897)</li>
<li>It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill—right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency. The solution? Establish a system for reflection and review. (Location 2900)</li>
<li>Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or statistics but about giving your “best effort spiritually and mentally and physically.” (Location 2916)</li>
<li>“Sustaining an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time.” (Location 2934)</li>
<li>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday. (Location 2937)</li>
<li>Improvement is not just about learning habits, it’s also about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary—like Pat Riley adjusting the effort of his players on a nightly basis. You don’t want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective. (Location 2949)</li>
<li>Annual Review, in which I reflect on the previous year. (Location 2952)</li>
<li>What went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What did I learn? (Location 2955)</li>
<li>Integrity Report. (Location 2958)</li>
<li>My Integrity Report helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wish to become.* (Location 2958)</li>
<li>What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future? (Location 2962)</li>
<li>They provide an annual reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me become the type of person I wish to be. (Location 2966)</li>
<li>Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. (Location 2971)</li>
<li>reflection and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of behavior change: identity. (Location 2973)</li>
<li>As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working against you, your identity creates a kind of “pride” that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits. (Location 2976)</li>
<li>One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham, “keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. (Location 2982)</li>
<li>The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes. “I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally tough and loves a physical challenge.” “I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.” “I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and creates things.” (Location 2992)</li>
<li>When chosen effectively, an identity can be flexible rather than brittle. Like water flowing around an obstacle, your identity works with the changing circumstances rather than against them. (Location 2997)</li>
<li>The following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas perfectly: Men are born soft and supple; dead, they are stiff and hard. Plants are born tender and pliant; dead, they are brittle and dry. Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible is a disciple of death. Whoever is soft and yielding is a disciple of life. The hard and stiff will be broken. The soft and supple will prevail. —LAO TZU (Location 2999)</li>
<li>Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you. A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review is the antidote. (Location 3006)</li>
<li>The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it. (Location 3014)</li>
<li>Sorites Paradox,* (Location 3016)</li>
<li>Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine. (Location 3032)</li>
<li>Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying. (Location 3036)</li>
<li>The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. (Location 3052)</li>
<li>Small habits don’t add up. They compound. (Location 3055)</li>
