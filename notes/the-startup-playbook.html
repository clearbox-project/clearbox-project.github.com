<ul>
<li>Developing one’s company-creation thesis requires a never-ending and humbling commitment. The simple mission is to truthfully reflect and understand, persistently press on, and perfect. “It’s the shift from defining ourselves as who we think we are to who we are becoming.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=94">Location 94</a>)</li>
<li>talented technology entrepreneur and blogger Chris Dixon, who observed: “Building a startup will be the homeownership of the next century.” He’s exactly right. The idea of the American Dream is rooted in our national ethos, in the belief that we have the freedom and self-directed power to create prosperity. But in the past, we have been led to believe that our single biggest asset is equity in our homes, when in fact, our best asset is ourselves: our gifts, our goals, our efforts. You are your best investment. The new American Dream is creating and building your own startup. The equity is you.

<li>If you consider how difficult and improbable breakout success is in any given market, you can begin to understand why it is so critical to use a battering ram of proprietary assets—beginning with the heart and mind of the founder—to break through. Your startup company must be rooted and flow from the founder’s innate gifts. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=157">Location 157</a>)</li>
<li>Entrepreneurs love options. This has been my greatest area of weakness as an entrepreneur. While you might think keeping your options open creates added opportunity and paths to fortune, it actually does the reverse. Having too many options serves to dilute the attention, resources, focus, and discipline it takes to learn how to prosper in a market. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=165">Location 165</a>)</li>
<li>The successful founder’s job is to get to the answer as quickly as possible. It’s a widely held belief in the tech valleys that you must fail fast. Ultimately, you are trying to unlock your product-to-market fit equation as quickly as your talent and capitalization will allow. It is critical to select your problem well, focus intensely, and crack the code. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=167">Location 167</a>)</li>
<li>Build Painkillers, Not Vitamins (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=170">Location 170</a>)</li>
<li>If you can’t describe your company’s value as a painkiller, then I recommend you redefine and refine your business thesis. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=177">Location 177</a>)</li>
<li>be ten times better than your competitors. You cannot be incrementally better. Incrementalism kills companies. Your entire organization must focus on an area of strength where you can defeat your competitors and radically differentiate your company by being ten times better than anyone else in the world. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=186">Location 186</a>)</li>
<li>thinking “monopolistically” was simply a way to focus on building market-dominating companies. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=193">Location 193</a>)</li>
<li>The fact is, we have a responsibility to take great risks because in truth, we have few true risks at all. I believe a life fully lived should be lived boldly, loaded with chances to push yourself to the greatest extremes of your abilities. We should be grateful that we have those kinds of opportunities. Seize them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=211">Location 211</a>)</li>
<li>Don’t Suffer from the Sin of Comparison. Follow Your Own Path. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=213">Location 213</a>)</li>
<li>You need to trust your gut, focus on the voice of your customers, and move forward on a committed, decisive path. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=218">Location 218</a>)</li>
<li>The physical and intellectual time recovered will be repurposed into your greatest gifts and efforts, leading to dramatic personal and economic returns. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=222">Location 222</a>)</li>
<li>I feel one of my most important jobs at my companies is to give my teams the ability to take great risks without fear of failure or peer contempt. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=229">Location 229</a>)</li>
<li>One of the most critical ways to survive the startup experience is to feed your unbreakable desire to see and touch a future that you feel you are uniquely created to invent. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=242">Location 242</a>)</li>
<li>The traditional advice is “follow your passions”; I’m not saying that at all. From a business-opportunity point of view, tracking other people’s passions is even more important. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=322">Location 322</a>)</li>
<li>The secret to a successful startup is that it won’t work until you can persuade other people to do your work for you, to engage in passionate evangelism for your product or service. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=327">Location 327</a>)</li>
<li>It’s not enough for something to be superficially “cool.” It has to be presented in a particular way so that a small number of people will get excited about it. Then those people will tell others, and that’s how it will spread. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=334">Location 334</a>)</li>
<li>Founders have to be part of the whole startup process. You have to smell and taste and absorb and feel every part of it, and keep rearranging the pieces until you suddenly feel it go “Snap!” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=337">Location 337</a>)</li>
<li>you have to constantly pay attention to your community’s center of interest and adapt your product to keep it. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=346">Location 346</a>)</li>
<li>when you’re threatened with the prospect of failure, that is a massive motivator. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=349">Location 349</a>)</li>
<li>The right strategy is to get through it; get yourself to a place, psychologically, where you have some perspective and make the big decisions when you’re strong. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=354">Location 354</a>)</li>
<li>Define Your Brand in Eight Words or Less (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=356">Location 356</a>)</li>
<li>Though it seemed to be destroying value, giving away digital content actually created demand. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=365">Location 365</a>)</li>
<li>Build Your Reputation Through Transparency (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=367">Location 367</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Just like gitlab</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Spreading a positive reputation might require giving away something that, traditionally, you would have treasured for yourself. It might have been worth protecting ten years ago, but it’s not worth protecting now. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=369">Location 369</a>)</li>
<li>Vision Is a Team Thing (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=373">Location 373</a>)</li>
<li>Everyone knows that hiring the right people is critical to an organization’s success. But you won’t get the best out of them unless you let them help shape your vision. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=374">Location 374</a>)</li>
<li>The goal has to be to do something that you can imagine yourself being passionate about for at least six years. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=456">Location 456</a>)</li>
<li>Create Transparent Choice Users will reward you for being transparent and giving them choices. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00AB12U4W&amp;location=461">Location 461</a>)</li>
