<ul>
<li>Science is an ongoing search for truth—a perpetual struggle to discover how the universe works that goes back to the earliest civilizations. Driven by human curiosity, it has relied on reasoning, observation, and experiment. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00TK7S6EG&amp;location=143">Location 143</a>)</li>
<li>A logical system for the scientific process was first put forward by the English philosopher Francis Bacon in the early 17th century. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00TK7S6EG&amp;location=151">Location 151</a>)</li>
<li>Bacon’s scientific method requires scientists to make observations, form a theory to explain what is going on, and then conduct an experiment to see whether the theory works. If it seems to be true, then the results may be sent out for peer review, in which people working in the same or a similar field are invited to pick holes in the argument, and so falsify the theory, or to repeat the experiment to make sure that the results are correct.
