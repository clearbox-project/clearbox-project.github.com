<li>A deeper understanding of judgments and choices also requires a richer vocabulary than is available in everyday language. The hope for informed gossip is that there are distinctive patterns in the errors people make.

<li>Systematic errors are known as biases, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=33">Location 33</a>)</li>

<li>improve the ability to identify and understand errors of judgment and choice, in others and eventually in ourselves, by providing a richer and more precise language to discuss them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=46">Location 46</a>)</li>

<li>The pleasure we found in working together made us exceptionally patient; it is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=71">Location 71</a>)</li>

<li>People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory—and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=126">Location 126</a>)</li>

<li>A recurrent theme of this book is that luck plays a large role in every story of success; it is almost always easy to identify a small change in the story that would have turned a remarkable achievement into a mediocre outcome.

<li>the marvels as well as the flaws of intuitive thought. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=164">Location 164</a>)</li>
<li>expert intuition: (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=175">Location 175</a>)</li>
<li>“The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=183">Location 183</a>)</li>
<li>emotion now looms much larger in our understanding of intuitive judgments and choices than it did in the past. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=196">Location 196</a>)</li>
<li>If the individual has relevant expertise, she will recognize the situation, and the intuitive solution that comes to her mind is likely to be correct. This is what happens when a chess master looks at a complex position: the few moves that immediately occur to him are all strong. When the question is difficult and a skilled solution is not available, intuition still has a shot: an answer may come to mind quickly—but it is not an answer to the original question. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=200">Location 200</a>)</li>
<li>This is the essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=204">Location 204</a>)</li>
<li>The spontaneous search for an intuitive solution sometimes fails—neither an expert solution nor a heuristic answer comes to mind. In such cases we often find ourselves switching to a slower, more deliberate and effortful form of thinking. This is the slow thinking of the title. Fast thinking includes both variants of intuitive thought—the expert and the heuristic—as well as the entirely automatic mental activities of perception and memory, the operations that enable you to know there is a lamp on your desk or retrieve the name of the capital of Russia.

<li>The process was mental work: deliberate, effortful, and orderly—a prototype of slow thinking. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=268">Location 268</a>)</li>
<li>Someone looking closely at your eyes while you tackled this problem would have seen your pupils dilate. Your pupils contracted back to normal size as soon as you ended your work—when you found the answer (which is 408, by the way) or when you gave up. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=269">Location 269</a>)</li>
<li>I describe System 1 as effortlessly originating impressions and feelings that are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of System 2. The automatic operations of System 1 generate surprisingly complex patterns of ideas, but only the slower System 2 can construct thoughts in an orderly series of steps. I also describe circumstances in which System 2 takes over, overruling the freewheeling impulses and associations of System 1. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=281">Location 281</a>)</li>
<li>System 2 has some ability to change the way System 1 works, by programming the normally automatic functions of attention and memory. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=311">Location 311</a>)</li>
<li>The often-used phrase “pay attention” is apt: you dispose of a limited budget of attention that you can allocate to activities, and if you try to go beyond your budget, you will fail. It is the mark of effortful activities that they interfere with each other, which is why it is difficult or impossible to conduct several at once. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=316">Location 316</a>)</li>
<li>Intense focusing on a task can make people effectively blind, even to stimuli that normally attract attention. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=324">Location 324</a>)</li>
<li>we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=334">Location 334</a>)</li>

<li>Note: this whole section is a summary of how the System 1 and System 2 work together</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The interaction of the two systems is a recurrent theme of the book, and a brief synopsis of the plot is in order. In the story I will tell, Systems 1 and 2 are both active whenever we are awake. System 1 runs automatically and System 2 is normally in a comfortable low-effort mode, in which only a fraction of its capacity is engaged. System 1 continuously generates suggestions for System 2: impressions, intuitions, intentions, and feelings. If endorsed by System 2, impressions and intuitions turn into beliefs, and impulses turn into voluntary actions. When all goes smoothly, which is most of the time, System 2 adopts the suggestions of System 1 with little or no modification. You generally believe your impressions and act on your desires, and that is fine—usually. When System 1 runs into difficulty, it calls on System 2 to support more detailed and specific processing that may solve the problem of the moment. System 2 is mobilized when a question arises for which System 1 does not offer an answer, as probably happened to you when you encountered the multiplication problem 17 × 24. You can also feel a surge of conscious attention whenever you are surprised. System 2 is activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world that System 1 maintains. In that world, lamps do not jump, cats do not bark, and gorillas do not cross basketball courts. The gorilla experiment demonstrates that some attention is needed for the surprising stimulus to be detected. Surprise then activates and orients your attention: you will stare, and you will search your memory for a story that makes sense of the surprising event. System 2 is also credited with the continuous monitoring of your own behavior—the control that keeps you polite when you are angry, and alert when you are driving at night. System 2 is mobilized to increased effort when it detects an error about to be made. Remember a time when you almost blurted out an offensive remark and note how hard you worked to restore control. In summary, most of what you (your System 2) think and do originates in your System 1, but System 2 takes over when things get difficult, and it normally has the last word. The division of labor between System 1 and System 2 is highly efficient: it minimizes effort and optimizes performance. The arrangement works well most of the time because System 1 is generally very… (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=336">Location 336</a>)</li>
<li>One of the tasks of System 2 is to overcome the impulses of System 1. In other words, System 2 is in charge of self-control. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=374">Location 374</a>)</li>
<li>Müller-Lyer illusion. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=379">Location 379</a>)</li>
<li>To resist the illusion, there is only one thing you can do: you must learn to mistrust your impressions of the length of lines when fins are attached to them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=385">Location 385</a>)</li>
<li>Not all illusions are visual. There are illusions of thought, which we call cognitive illusions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=388">Location 388</a>)</li>
<li>System 1 operates automatically and cannot be turned off at will, errors of intuitive thought are often difficult to prevent. Biases cannot always be avoided, because System 2 may have no clue to the error. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=402">Location 402</a>)</li>
<li>The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high. The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=406">Location 406</a>)</li>
<li>“Automatic system” takes longer to say than “System 1” and therefore takes more space in your working memory. This matters, because anything that occupies your working memory reduces your ability to think. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=430">Location 430</a>)</li>
<li>the pupils are sensitive indicators of mental effort—they dilate substantially when people multiply two-digit numbers, and they dilate more if the problems are hard than if they are easy. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=463">Location 463</a>)</li>
<li>a window to your soul.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=489">Location 489</a>)</li>
<li>The Add-1 and Add-3 exercises are sprints, and casual chatting is a stroll. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=495">Location 495</a>)</li>
<li>the response to mental overload is selective and precise: System 2 protects the most important activity, so it receives the attention it needs; “spare capacity” is allocated second by second to other tasks. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=511">Location 511</a>)</li>
<li>System 1 takes over in emergencies and assigns total priority to self-protective actions. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=518">Location 518</a>)</li>
<li>As you become skilled in a task, its demand for energy diminishes. Studies of the brain have shown that the pattern of activity associated with an action changes as skill increases, with fewer brain regions involved. Talent has similar effects. Highly intelligent individuals need less effort to solve the same problems, as indicated by both pupil size and brain activity. A general “law of least effort” applies to cognitive as well as physical exertion. The law asserts that if there are several ways of achieving the same goal, people will eventually gravitate to the least demanding course of action. In the economy of action, effort is a cost, and the acquisition of skill is driven by the balance of benefits and costs. Laziness is built deep into our nature. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=523">Location 523</a>)</li>
<li>Effort is required to maintain simultaneously in memory several ideas that require separate actions, or that need to be combined according to a rule— (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=538">Location 538</a>)</li>
<li>System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=541">Location 541</a>)</li>
<li>System 1 detects simple relations (“they are all alike,” “the son is much taller than the father”) and excels at integrating information about one thing, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=542">Location 542</a>)</li>
<li>A crucial capability of System 2 is the adoption of “task sets”: it can program memory to obey an instruction that overrides habitual responses. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=546">Location 546</a>)</li>
<li>switching from one task to another is effortful, especially under time pressure. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=555">Location 555</a>)</li>
<li>Modern tests of working memory require the individual to switch repeatedly between two demanding tasks, retaining the results of one operation while performing the other. People who do well on these tests tend to do well on tests of general intelligence. However, the ability to control attention is not simply a measure of intelligence; (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=559">Location 559</a>)</li>
<li>Any task that requires you to keep several ideas in mind at the same time has the same hurried character. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=565">Location 565</a>)</li>
<li>The most effortful forms of slow thinking are those that require you to think fast. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=566">Location 566</a>)</li>
<li>We normally avoid mental overload by dividing our tasks into multiple easy steps, committing intermediate results to long-term memory or to paper rather than to an easily overloaded working memory. We cover long distances by taking our time and conduct our mental lives by the law of least effort. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=569">Location 569</a>)</li>
<li>Self-control and deliberate thought apparently draw on the same limited budget of effort. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=599">Location 599</a>)</li>
<li>Even in the absence of time pressure, maintaining a coherent train of thought requires discipline. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=603">Location 603</a>)</li>
<li>cognitive work is not always aversive, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=605">Location 605</a>)</li>
<li>“a state of effortless concentration so deep that they lose their sense of time, of themselves, of their problems,” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=608">Location 608</a>)</li>
<li>Flow neatly separates the two forms of effort: concentration on the task and the deliberate control of attention. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=611">Location 611</a>)</li>
<li>System 1 has more influence on behavior when System 2 is busy, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=620">Location 620</a>)</li>
<li>People who are cognitively busy are also more likely to make selfish choices, use sexist language, and make superficial judgments in social situations. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=620">Location 620</a>)</li>
<li>cognitive load is not the only cause of weakened self-control. A few drinks have the same effect, as does a sleepless night. The self-control of morning people is impaired at night; the reverse is true of night people. Too much concern about how well one is doing in a task sometimes disrupts performance by loading short-term memory with pointless anxious thoughts. The conclusion is straightforward: self-control requires attention and effort. Another way of saying this is that controlling thoughts and behaviors is one of the tasks that System 2 performs. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=622">Location 622</a>)</li>
<li>all variants of voluntary effort—cognitive, emotional, or physical—draw at least partly on a shared pool of mental energy. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=627">Location 627</a>)</li>
<li>an effort of will or self-control is tiring; if you have had to force yourself to do something, you are less willing or less able to exert self-control when the next challenge comes around. The phenomenon has been named ego depletion. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=629">Location 629</a>)</li>
<li>All involve conflict and the need to suppress a natural tendency. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=636">Location 636</a>)</li>
<li>Unlike cognitive load, ego depletion is at least in part a loss of motivation. After exerting self-control in one task, you do not feel like making an effort in another, although you could do it if you really had to. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=646">Location 646</a>)</li>
<li>Ego depletion is not the same mental state as cognitive busyness. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=649">Location 649</a>)</li>
<li>the idea of mental energy is more than a mere metaphor. The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to be especially expensive in the currency of glucose. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=650">Location 650</a>)</li>
<li>ego depletion could be undone by ingesting glucose, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=653">Location 653</a>)</li>

<li>when people believe a conclusion is true, they are also very likely to believe arguments that appear to support it, even when these arguments are unsound. If System 1 is involved, the conclusion comes first and the arguments follow. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=700">Location 700</a>)</li>

<li>The ease with which they are satisfied enough to stop thinking is rather troubling. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=721">Location 721</a>)</li>
<li>“Lazy” is a harsh judgment about the self-monitoring of these young people and their System 2, but it does not seem to be unfair. Those who avoid the sin of intellectual sloth could be called “engaged.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=721">Location 721</a>)</li>
<li>The psychologist Keith Stanovich would call them more rational. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=724">Location 724</a>)</li>

<li>the children who had shown more self-control as four-year-olds had substantially higher scores on tests of intelligence. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=737">Location 737</a>)</li>
<li>Other research by the same group identified specific genes that are involved in the control of attention, showed that parenting techniques also affected this ability, and demonstrated a close connection between the children’s ability to control their attention and their ability to control their emotions.

<li>System 1 is impulsive and intuitive; System 2 is capable of reasoning, and it is cautious, but at least for some people it is also lazy. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=755">Location 755</a>)</li>
<li>Keith Stanovich and his longtime collaborator Richard West originally introduced the terms System 1 and System 2 (they now prefer to speak of Type 1 and Type 2 processes). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B00555X8OA&amp;location=758">Location 758</a>)</li>

<li>The core of his argument is that rationality should be distinguished from intelligence. In his view, superficial or “lazy” thinking is a flaw in the reflective mind, a failure of rationality.
