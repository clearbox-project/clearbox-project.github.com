<ul>
<li>Shortly after Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution, biologists realized that the human brain itself had evolved over time, and that its evolutionary history is evident from just looking at it. (Location 289)</li>
<li>Over time, the brain grew capable of increasingly complex behaviors by evolving new parts on top of the older parts. This method of growth by addition applies to the brains of most complex animals. (Location 295)</li>
<li>It is easy to see why the old brain parts are still there. No matter how smart and sophisticated we are, breathing, eating, sex, and reflex reactions are still critical to our survival. (Location 297)</li>
<li>Your neocortex is reading or listening to this book, and my neocortex is writing this book. (Location 306)
<ul>
<li>Note: Time machine</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The neocortex is in a decidedly unfair position, as it doesn’t control behavior directly. (Location 312)</li>
<li>This battle between the old and new brain is an underlying theme of this book. It will play an important role when we discuss the existential risks facing humanity. (Location 318)</li>
<li>The neocortex is surprisingly different. Although it occupies almost three-quarters of the brain’s volume and is responsible for a myriad of cognitive functions, it has no visually obvious divisions. (Location 322)</li>
