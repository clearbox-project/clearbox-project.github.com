<li>The past was once the future and the future will become the past. (Location 246)</li>
<li>I believe the best predictions are based on understanding the fundamental forces involved, and this is what I depend on mainly. Often it is not physical limitations which control but rather it is human made laws, habits, and organizational rules, regulations, personal egos, and inertia, which dominate the evolution to the future. (Location 248)</li>
<li>individual choices can make large differences at times. (Location 265)
<ul>
<li>Note: The unpredictableness is the core of historical events. If they are expected, they are not information, and not worth being recorded.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can decide the future is less open ended than you would like to believe, and there is really less choice than there appears to be (Location 267)</li>
<li>It is probable the future will be more limited by the slow evolution of the human animal and the corresponding human laws, social institution, and organizations than it will be by the rapid evolution of technology. (Location 268)

<li>It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.

<li>your vision of your future. (Location 279)</li>
<li>the accuracy of the vision matters less than you might suppose, getting anywhere is better than drifting, there are potentially many paths to greatness for you, and just which path you go on, so long as it takes you to greatness, is none of my business (Location 281)</li>
<li>No vision, not much of a future. (Location 284)</li>
