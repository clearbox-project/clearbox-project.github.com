<ul>
<li>The linguist Noam Chomsky once suggested that our ignorance can be divided into problems and mysteries. When we face a problem, we may not know its solution, but we have insight, increasing knowledge, and an inkling of what we are looking for. When we face a mystery, however, we can only stare in wonder and bewilderment, not knowing what an explanation would even look like.

<li>It is that the engineering problems that we humans solve as we see and walk and plan and make it through the day are far more challenging than landing on the moon or sequencing the human genome.

<li>we should direct our awe not at Shakespeare or Mozart or Einstein or Kareem Abdul-Jabbar but at a four-year old carrying out a request to put a toy on a shelf. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0042XA2XG&amp;location=113">Location 113</a>)</li>
<li>The mind, like the Apollo spacecraft, is designed to solve many engineering problems, and thus is packed with high-tech systems each contrived to overcome its own obstacles. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0042XA2XG&amp;location=122">Location 122</a>)</li>
