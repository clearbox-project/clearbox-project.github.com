<li><p>The whole idea of Science is, simply, reflective reasoning about a more reliable process for making the contents of your mind mirror the contents of the world. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01grmwr3xj5ahe4n111q3w65a2">View Highlight</a>)</p></li>

If you can see this—if you can see that hope is shifting your <em>first-order</em> thoughts by too large a degree—if you can understand your mind as a mapping engine that has flaws—then you can apply a reflective correction. The brain is a flawed lens through which to see reality. This is true of both mouse brains and human brains. But a human brain is a flawed lens that can understand its own flaws—its systematic errors, its biases—and apply second-order corrections to them. This, <em>in practice,</em> makes the lens far more powerful. Not perfect, but far more powerful (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsbb3pdysyk2j47y3y3bxv60">View Highlight</a>)</p></li>
