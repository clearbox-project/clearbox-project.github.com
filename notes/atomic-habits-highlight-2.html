<ul>
<li>The more tasks you can handle without thinking, the more your brain is free to focus on other areas. (Location 270)
<ul>
<li>Note: PI 我曾经觉得只要我知道怎么做就好,从没有想过将过脑子的事务变成本能。</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Furthermore, each book you read not only teaches you something new but also opens up different ways of thinking about old ideas. (Location 273)</li>
<li>People reflect your behavior back to you. (Location 275)</li>
<li>Negative thoughts compound. The more you think of yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way. You get trapped in a thought loop. The same is true for how you think about others. Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere. (Location 281)
<ul>
<li>Note: 我有这个倾向,一定要注意</li>

<li>the result of a single event. Instead, a long series of microaggressions (Location 284)</li>
<li>It doesn’t feel like you are going anywhere. It’s a hallmark of any compounding process: the most powerful outcomes are delayed. (Location 298)
<ul>
<li>Note: It's Exactly what i am feeling right now, about my newsletter.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential. (Location 301)</li>
<li>When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success. (Location 306)</li>
<li>Mastery requires patience. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.” (Location 311)</li>
<li>FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD (Location 325)</li>
<li>The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. (Location 342)</li>
<li>What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. (Location 358)</li>
<li>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress. (Location 374)</li>
<li>You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. (Location 396)</li>
<li>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. (Location 405)</li>
<li>The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level. (Location 415)</li>
<li>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. (Location 417)</li>
<li>With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become. (Location 426)</li>
<li>Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. (Location 435)</li>
<li>The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. (Location 452)</li>
<li>Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are. (Location 460)</li>
<li>Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. (Location 465)</li>
<li>When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. (Location 479)</li>
<li>Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. (Location 486)</li>
<li>In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” (Location 496)</li>
<li>The more evidence you have for a belief, the more strongly you will believe it. (Location 501)</li>
<li>Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. (Location 517)</li>
<li>It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins. (Location 529)</li>
<li>The focus should always be on becoming that type of person, not getting a particular outcome. (Location 550)</li>
<li>Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone. Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits. (Location 559)</li>
<li>Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. (Location 566)</li>
<li>Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. (Location 567)</li>
<li>“behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” (Location 588)</li>
<li>This is the feedback loop behind all human behavior: try, fail, learn, try differently. With practice, the useless movements fade away and the useful actions get reinforced. That’s a habit forming. (Location 601)</li>
<li>As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.” (Location 603)</li>
<li>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. (Location 610)</li>
<li>Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. (Location 612)
<ul>
<li>Note: Limited resource leads to the way the brain works. I wonder what if we can use AI for most of the "habit" tasks. Probably a good startup idea.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks. (Location 615)</li>
<li>spontaneity of life?” Hardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. (Location 618)</li>
<li>when you have your habits dialed in and the basics of life are handled and done, your mind is free to focus on new challenges and master the next set of problems. Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future. (Location 625)</li>
<li>cue, craving, response, and reward. (Location 628)</li>
<li>Today, we spend most of our time learning cues that predict secondary rewards like money and fame, power and status, praise and approval, love and friendship, or a sense of personal satisfaction. (Of course, these pursuits also indirectly improve our odds of survival and reproduction, which is the deeper motive behind everything we do.) (Location 634)</li>
<li>What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. (Location 639)</li>
<li>Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. (Location 641)</li>
<li>Cues are meaningless until they are interpreted. The thoughts, feelings, and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving. (Location 645)</li>
<li>The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. (Location 646)</li>
<li>Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. (Location 647)</li>
<li>Your response also depends on your ability. (Location 648)</li>
<li>Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us. (Location 651)</li>
<li>Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].” (Location 897)</li>
<li>The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit. (Location 901)</li>
<li>Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is: “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” (Location 905)</li>
<li>The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to change in a new environment. (Location 1138)</li>
<li>The mantra I find useful is “One space, one use.” (Location 1149)</li>
<li>If you want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an environment that is stable and predictable. (Location 1166)</li>
<li>Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it. (Location 1216)</li>
<li>Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. (Location 1220)</li>
<li>This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change. Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. (Location 1233)</li>
<li>Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are done out of habit. (Location 1938)</li>
<li>Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. (Location 1941)</li>
<li>Decisive moments set the options available to your future self. (Location 1955)</li>
<li>Habits are the entry point, not the end point. (Location 1961)</li>
<li>But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. (Location 1997)</li>
<li>The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. (Location 2001)</li>
<li>The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily journaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said. (Location 2016)</li>
<li>once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. (Location 2024)</li>
<li>Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the behavior. Then, advance to an (Location 2026)</li>
<li>The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” (Location 2057)</li>
<li>When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.” (Location 2141)</li>
<li>manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. (Location 2418)</li>
<li>The habit stacking + habit tracking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [TRACK MY HABIT]. (Location 2421)</li>
<li>simple rule: never miss twice. (Location 2432)</li>
<li>The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. (Location 2435)</li>
<li>we fall into an all-or-nothing cycle with our habits. The problem is not slipping up; the problem is thinking that if you can’t do something perfectly, then you shouldn’t do it at all. (Location 2440)</li>
<li>You don’t realize how valuable it is to just show up on your bad (or busy) days. Lost days hurt you more than successful days help you. (Location 2441)</li>
<li>As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” (Location 2443)</li>
<li>Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance, but it reaffirms your identity. (Location 2448)</li>
<li>If your success is measured by a lower number on the scale, you will optimize for a lower number on the scale, (Location 2459)</li>
<li>This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system. (Location 2464)</li>
<li>just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all. (Location 2468)</li>
