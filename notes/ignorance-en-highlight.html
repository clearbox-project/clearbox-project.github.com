<ul>
<li>What is key here is that we can’t always know what we don’t know. (Location 26)</li>
<li>Consequently, when trying to make predictions about the future, scientists should adopt a more nuanced approach. One way to do this would be to make predictions in the form of a question rather than a statement. (Location 43)</li>
<li>Many people believe that knowledge is the starting point for scientific inquiry. However, scientific research actually starts with ignorance, or the absence of knowledge. (Location 49)</li>
<li>There are two different types of ignorance. The first is willful stupidity. This is when you deliberately ignore facts or logic, often to maintain your beliefs about the world. The second is the absence of facts or insight. This kind of ignorance has both to do with an individual's lack of knowledge and a communal gap in knowledge. This, unlike willful stupidity, is a valuable kind of ignorance, and in fact spurs scientific research. (Location 50)</li>
<li>one question can give rise to many answers and inspire valuable research. (Location 54)</li>
<li>One answered question inspires new questions. (Location 57)</li>
<li>Thus when you prove yourself wrong, you reveal your ignorance; and have a whole new world of questions to ask and pursue. (Location 63)</li>
<li>“Knowledge is a big subject. Ignorance is bigger.” (Location 64)</li>
