<ul>
<li>A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them. —Marshall McLuhan, 1964 (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=44">Location 44</a>)</li>
<li>JACKIE TREEHORN: “New technology permits us to do very exciting things in interactive and erotic software. The wave of the future Dude, one hundred percent electronic.”     THE DUDE: “Hmm . . . well, I still jerk off manually.” —The Big Lebowski, 1998 (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=46">Location 46</a>)</li>
<li>The album was Aretha Franklin’s Live at the Fillmore West, and the combination of the Queen of Soul and a sunny summer day in my new neighborhood was impossible to resist. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=57">Location 57</a>)</li>
<li>the harmonic guitar rock debut from local band Always, a fresh compilation from Nigerian psych-disco hermit William Onyeabor, the stripped-back instrumental hip-hop collaboration from rap legend Ghostface Killah and funk band BadBadNotGood. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=74">Location 74</a>)</li>
<li>complete works of Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass), (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=129">Location 129</a>)</li>
<li>There was a richness to the vinyl record experience that transcended any quantifiable measurement. It was more fun precisely because it was less efficient. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=135">Location 135</a>)</li>
<li>It shows that the process of technological innovation isn’t a story of a slow march from good to better to best; it’s a series of trials that helps us understand who we are and how we operate. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=177">Location 177</a>)</li>
<li>The honeymoon with a particular digital technology inevitably ends, and when it does, we are more readily able to judge its true merits and shortcomings. In many cases, an older analog tool or approach simply works better. Its inherent inefficiency grows coveted; its weakness becomes a renewed strength. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=185">Location 185</a>)</li>
<li>Surrounded by digital, we now crave experiences that are more tactile and human-centric. We want to interact with goods and services with all our senses, and many of us are willing to pay a premium to do so, even if it is more cumbersome and costly than its digital equivalent. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=188">Location 188</a>)</li>
<li>the natural constraints analog technology imposes on its users can actually increase productivity, rather than hinder it. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=198">Location 198</a>)</li>
<li>The choice we face isn’t between digital and analog. That simplistic duality is actually the language that digital has conditioned us to: a false binary choice between 1 and 0, black and white, Samsung and Apple. The real world isn’t black or white. It is not even gray. Reality is multicolored, infinitely textured, and emotionally layered. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=215">Location 215</a>)</li>
<li>A Dave Matthews Band album is born right next to classic reissues from Primus, Pearl Jam, and the Wu-Tang Clan; chart toppers by Lana Del Rey; colored Iron Maiden collectors’ editions; a special release by Elvira “Mistress of the Dark”; and neo disco by Chromeo. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=237">Location 237</a>)</li>
<li>Grand Ole Opry and the Johnny Cash Museum (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=268">Location 268</a>)</li>
<li>Jack White and the Black Keys, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=271">Location 271</a>)</li>
<li>“Digitization is the peak of convenience, but vinyl is the peak of the experience, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=322">Location 322</a>)</li>
<li>“Digital is about making sure everyone has their music, and vinyl is the deluxe version, for the real music lover.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=324">Location 324</a>)</li>
<li>(George Benson’s Beyond the Blue Horizon, still one of my favorite jazz albums), (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=339">Location 339</a>)</li>
<li>First, the vinyl record never died. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=374">Location 374</a>)</li>
<li>Second, digital helped save the very analog record it nearly killed. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=387">Location 387</a>)</li>
<li>Millions of albums were auctioned on eBay, sold on Amazon, and traded on the massive online marketplace Discogs. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=388">Location 388</a>)</li>
<li>Once music was divorced from any physical object, its supply so vastly exceeded demand that people simply refused to pay for it. Suddenly, an album was no longer a desirable object worthy of consumption. All digital music listeners are equal. Acquisition is painless. Taste is irrelevant. It is pointless to boast about your iTunes collection, or the quality of your playlists on a streaming service. Music became data, one more set of 1’s and 0’s lurking in your hard drive, invisible to see and impossible to touch. Nothing is less cool than data. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=393">Location 393</a>)</li>
<li>consumers spend money to acquire them, they gain a genuine sense of ownership over the music, which translates into pride. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=399">Location 399</a>)</li>
<li>The third major reason for the revenge of vinyl was more deliberate: Record Store Day. This annual celebration of vinyl record retailing occurs the third Saturday of each April, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=411">Location 411</a>)</li>
<li>Death Cab for Cutie, R.E.M., Vampire Weekend, and Jason Mraz, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=446">Location 446</a>)</li>
<li>Compare that to digital downloads, where he estimates a label needs to sell over 127,000 singles to break even on the production of an album. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=515">Location 515</a>)</li>
<li>“The average price of that CD is six dollars wholesale, and you maybe get sixty cents [wholesale] on iTunes,” Crupnick said. “But suddenly on vinyl, you can bump up to ten or twelve dollars wholesale . . . that’s significantly more profitable than other models.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=516">Location 516</a>)</li>
<li>“With streaming they get paid in pennies,” Michael Kurtz said. “With vinyl they get paid in dollars. It’s a completely different world. If an artist and label knows what they’re doing, they’re going to make hard cash.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=535">Location 535</a>)</li>
<li>it’s no surprise that major artists from Radiohead’s Thom Yorke to Taylor Swift have refused to work with certain streaming services. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=537">Location 537</a>)</li>
<li>the streaming services have proven technology, but unproven business models. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=538">Location 538</a>)</li>
<li>“the future of music is the past.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=546">Location 546</a>)</li>
<li>“With vinyl, you’re on your knees,” White told Billboard. “You’re at the mercy of the needle. You watch the record spin and it’s like you’re sitting around a campfire. It’s hypnotic. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=560">Location 560</a>)</li>
<li>White has said that there is no romance in a mouse click; (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=562">Location 562</a>)</li>
<li>Lazaretto, an album so packed with wild quirks and design features—a hidden hologram, a secret track on the label, an A side that plays from the inside out (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=564">Location 564</a>)</li>
<li>Third Man Records (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=566">Location 566</a>)</li>
<li>There were no more mistakes. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=600">Location 600</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Which we artificially create mistakes to make it more human.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you wanted an echo before Pro Tools, someone had to perform at one end of a long concrete echo chamber, with a microphone placed at the other end. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=605">Location 605</a>)</li>
<li>White, Dave Grohl, and Gillian Welch, began experimenting with old tape machines and vintage studio equipment, returning to the analog methods they’d once used. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=608">Location 608</a>)</li>
<li>Miles Davis’s Kind of Blue to the Beastie Boys’ License to Ill (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=630">Location 630</a>)</li>
<li>“People think limitations are a bad thing,” Mara said. “But it moves the process forward, in a good way. You can easily get lost in the process. It’s easier to stick to the plan when you have limitations.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=631">Location 631</a>)</li>
<li>Hard Day’s Night. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=634">Location 634</a>)</li>
<li>David Bowie, Pink Floyd, the Rolling Stones, Lou Reed, Elton John, Devo, and Duran Duran, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=636">Location 636</a>)</li>
<li>Abbey Road and Dark Side of the Moon, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=648">Location 648</a>)</li>
<li>Daft Punk and Kanye West, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=648">Location 648</a>)</li>
<li>“A lot of recording has lost its soul,” Scott told me, as some bubblegum country pop played in the Starbucks where we met. “It comes from the head more than the heart. Done by looking at a screen, instead of listening.” No one took risks anymore. Take “Five Years,” the opening track on David Bowie’s masterpiece The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust, an album Scott had engineered. “The end of that song is so emotional,” Scott said. “Bowie literally had tears streaming down his face as he was singing it.” Today, an audio engineer would smooth out those cracks in Bowie’s voice with Pro Tools as he sang his heart out, even though that shaking voice is precisely what makes the song’s finale so arresting. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=651">Location 651</a>)</li>
<li>Two of my favorite albums from 2015 were both proudly analog: Black Messiah, a triumphant, ripping comeback by the soul singer D’Angelo, and Sour Soul, a collaboration between Wu-Tang Clan veteran Ghostface Killah and the instrumental funk band BadBadNotGood. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=661">Location 661</a>)</li>
<li>While paper use may have shrunk in certain areas since the introduction of digital communications, in other uses and purposes, paper’s emotional, functional, and economic value has increased. Paper may be used less, but where it is growing, paper is worth more. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=719">Location 719</a>)</li>
<li>“We as human beings need to be stimulated with our senses, very physically. With sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=737">Location 737</a>)</li>
<li>The Songlines by British travel writer Bruce Chatwin, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=751">Location 751</a>)</li>
<li>In his book The Organized Mind, cognitive psychologist and neuroscientist Daniel Levitin talks about the tremendous harm inflicted on us by information overload, which he claims is worse for your brain than exhaustion and smoking marijuana (he calls multitasking “empty-calories brain candy”). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=827">Location 827</a>)</li>
<li>Numerous studies have shown that handwriting notes is simply better for engagement, information retention, and mental health than is writing on digital devices. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=829">Location 829</a>)</li>
<li>Moleskinerie (a visual gallery of Moleskines filled with beautiful drawings), Getting Things Done, student blogs from computer science classes at MIT, and Mike Rohde’s sketchnote community. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01IMZ5GGM&amp;location=841">Location 841</a>)</li>
<li>Rohde’s sketchnote method, which combines illustrations with writing to effectively communicate ideas, is so popular that he has authored two best-selling books, and there are several online communities devoted to the practice, where tens of thousands of users share photos, illustrations, and videos of sketchnote-filled Moleskines.
