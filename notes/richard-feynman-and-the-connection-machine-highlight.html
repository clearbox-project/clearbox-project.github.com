<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>Forget all that `local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h961y9kc32csh9ms5y9frzrt">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h962a8c7ryfz9z696eemymr6">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. "Don't bug me. I'm busy," he would say without even looking up. (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h962drcdv19c3fvvqb67cjdh">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>Fokker Planck equations (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h962k2bfeggmn5trz42xyg4v">View Highlight</a>)</li>
<li>When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. "Hey, we got it right!" he said. "Not bad for amateurs." (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h962rnxpv3a4kmk585trjd6a">View Highlight</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: attitude</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress.

<li>"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway." (<a href="https://read.readwise.io/read/01h962zz9maesz4kr2pwyryatv">View Highlight</a>)</li>
