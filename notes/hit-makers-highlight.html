<ul>
<li>Radio signals weren’t moving in the late 1870s. But German families were. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=301">Location 301</a>)</li>
<li>His lullaby was an instant success not because it was incomparably original, but because it offered a familiar melody in an original setting. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=329">Location 329</a>)</li>
<li>In the psychology of aesthetics, there is a name for the moment between the anxiety of confronting something new and the satisfying click of understanding it. It is called an “aesthetic aha.” This is the first thesis of the book. Most consumers are simultaneously neophilic—curious to discover new things—and deeply neophobic—afraid of anything that’s too new. The best hit makers are gifted at creating moments of meaning by marrying new and old, anxiety and understanding. They are architects of familiar surprises.

<li>Brahms’s musical genius gave the song its appeal. But German emigration helped to give the lullaby its reach. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=342">Location 342</a>)</li>
<li>So the first question for people with a new product is: How do I get my idea to my audience? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=346">Location 346</a>)</li>
<li>How can I make something that people will share on their own—with the audience of my audience? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=349">Location 349</a>)</li>
<li>Content might be king, but distribution is the kingdom. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=356">Location 356</a>)</li>
<li>San Francisco tech tycoons like entrepreneur Kevin Rose, journalist M. G. Siegler, tech evangelist Robert Scoble, and Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=366">Location 366</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: to follow</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is rarely sufficient to design the perfect product without designing an equally thoughtful plan to get it to the right people. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=374">Location 374</a>)</li>
<li>The future of hits will be democratic, chaotic, and unequal. Millions will compete for attention, a happy few will go big, and a microscopic minority will get fantastically rich. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=379">Location 379</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: Why it’s unequal and democratic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In 2012, for the first time ever, Americans spent more time interacting with digital devices like their laptops and phones than with television. In 2013, the world produced almost four billion square feet of LCD screens, or about eighty square inches for every living human being. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=395">Location 395</a>)</li>
<li>the world’s attention is shifting from content that is infrequent, big, and broadcast (i.e., millions of people going to the movies once a week) to content that is frequent, small, and social (i.e., billions of people looking at social media feeds on their own glass-and-pixel displays every few minutes). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=399">Location 399</a>)</li>
<li>In 2015, the technology analyst Mary Meeker reported that one quarter of America’s media attention is devoted to mobile devices that did not exist a decade ago. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=404">Location 404</a>)</li>
<li>Television once freed “moving images” from the clutches of the cineplex; in the historical sequel, mobile technology is emancipating video from the living room. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=406">Location 406</a>)</li>
<li>As the medium changed, so have the messages. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=407">Location 407</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: medium is the message. Need to learn more on that book.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Actors used to go to Los Angeles or New York because those cities housed the gatekeepers who owned the distribution of media. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=418">Location 418</a>)</li>
<li>Technology has always shaped entertainment—and our expectations of what sort of content is “good.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=420">Location 420</a>)</li>
<li>The first ten-inch vinyl records could comfortably hold about three minutes of music, which helped shape expectations that a modern pop single shouldn’t be more than 240 seconds. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=422">Location 422</a>)</li>
<li>We used to merely consume content. Now the content consumes us too—our behaviors, our rituals, and our identities. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B01HNJIJ58&amp;location=427">Location 427</a>)</li>
