{"## New highlights added April 6, 2023 at 4": "18 PM", "- This wave example illustrates three important points. First, substrate independence doesn\u2019t mean that a substrate is unnecessary, but that most of its details don\u2019t matter. You obviously can\u2019t have sound waves in a gas if there\u2019s no gas, but any gas whatsoever will suffice. Similarly, you obviously can\u2019t have computation without matter, but any matter will do as long as it can be arranged into NAND gates, connected neurons or some other building block enabling universal computation. Second, the substrate-independent phenomenon takes on a life of its own, independent of its substrate. A wave can travel across a lake, even though none of its water molecules do\u2014they mostly bob up and down, like fans doing \u201cthe wave\u201d in a sports stadium. Third, it\u2019s often only the substrate-independent aspect that we\u2019re interested in": "a surfer usually cares more about the position and height of a wave than about its detailed molecular composition. We saw how this was true for information, and it\u2019s true for computation too: if two programmers are jointly hunting a bug in their code, they\u2019re probably not discussing transistors.
