<li>Tech visions typically start with one person with an idea. Early on that visionary faces skepticism and rejection. But if the visionary has sufficient technical proficiency and the support of colleagues, he or she may hang on long enough to get a prototype working, an accomplishment that attracts others, who soon come to share in the vision, and thus a technology project snowballs, attracting more bright people, more funding, and, hopefully, widespread adoption. In time the vision gets stale, and the visionary grows stubborn, as others dream up new visions that challenge then replace the old.

<li>Children seem to be such remarkable learners on their own, but then they enter school. —Seymour Papert (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=194">Location 194</a>)</li>
<li>There will always be naysayers. They’re the same people who go from saying it’s impossible to saying it’s inevitable. —Elon Musk (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=196">Location 196</a>)</li>
<li>Thorndike called this “the law of effect,” wherein an organism increases over time the frequency of a behavior that yields satisfactory outcomes arising from that behavior, and reduces over time the frequency of behaviors yielding unsatisfactory outcomes. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=252">Location 252</a>)</li>
<li>“The human species evolved in a tropical climate and certainly without the benefit of clothing,” Skinner wrote. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=266">Location 266</a>)</li>
<li>Whether Eliot knew it or not, Skinner felt, she was breaking not one but two sacred rules, rules this staunch behaviorist believed were bedrock-foundational principles of learning: Self-Pacing and Immediate Feedback. If those two principles were not practiced in a classroom setting, the teacher was impeding learning, plain and simple. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=303">Location 303</a>)</li>
<li>But perhaps there was a way to solve this conundrum. Especially if the focus were more on helping the child learn, and less on helping the teacher teach. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=343">Location 343</a>)</li>
<li>Katharine Taylor, Shady Hill’s founding director, who had been handpicked from the Francis Parker School in Chicago, would write, in 1937, regarding teaching, “The more you think of teaching the more you realize that it can never be classified as science. It is nearer to being an art. It makes use of the findings of science, but the ability to teach can never be fully acquired through scientific pursuit alone, and the procedure of teaching can never be organized purely as a science.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=403">Location 403</a>)</li>
<li>Soon the general name for this powerful notion would be called “time-sharing.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=552">Location 552</a>)</li>
<li>On Saturday one Frenchman quipped, “The Russians put up Sputnik yesterday, and it goes around the world saying beep-beep-beep. Then, when it gets to the U.S., it says ha-ha-ha.” In those first few days after October 4, American newspapers struggled to describe Sputnik, many choosing to refer to it as “ARTIFICIAL MOON,” or, just as likely, “RED MOON.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=610">Location 610</a>)

<li>To them Sputnik “had become the second momentous event of the Cold War. The first had been the Soviet development of the atomic bomb in 1953.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=626">Location 626</a>)</li>
<li>America has witnessed such reactions and manipulations many times since. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=686">Location 686</a>)</li>
<li>His approach fit more with the present-day Silicon Valley mind-set of build something, anything, get it up and running, and show it to other people as soon as possible. Silicon Valley calls it demo or die. Stop yakking and build the damn thing and prove it does what you say it is supposed to do.

<li>I came in with the name ‘PLATO,’ and I said ‘Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations.’ ” Bitzer recalls Braunfeld saying, “No, no, we can’t say that, ‘Automated’ means self-mated, we don’t want to give that image, we’ll call it ‘Automatic.’ So we made that change, and that was it, and then we got down to work.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=1213">Location 1213</a>)</li>
<li>failure was actually success—congratulations were in order—in that it meant one could scratch one approach off the list and move on to try a different approach. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=1686">Location 1686</a>)</li>
<li>To their shock they discovered people felt they were too good, and judged their work not to be their own. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=1716">Location 1716</a>)</li>
<li>For a long time afterward, Hanson would question “whether scientists were really to be trusted when they said they believed in research for its own sake; clearly this group did not.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=1729">Location 1729</a>)</li>
<li>It was not yet apparent to the PLATO team in 1960 that Moore’s Law was already under way. To appreciate what they were up against, consider how prohibitively expensive random-access memory (RAM) was for a computer then: $2 per bit. Take the typical 8 gigabytes of RAM found in a single present-day laptop: at $2 per bit, that much RAM in the early 1960s would cost $68 billion in 1962 dollars, or nearly $500 billion in 2017 dollars. That’s for one laptop. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=1859">Location 1859</a>)</li>
<li>Stolurow decided to build his own system. He named it SOCRATES, which stood for “System for Organizing Content to Review and Teach Educational Subjects.” A more blunt statement about PLATO is hard to imagine: in ancient Greece, Socrates was Plato’s teacher. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06W9N6F5R&amp;location=2191">Location 2191</a>)</li>
<li>They were driven by a more pragmatic approach: you work with students, you work with content, you work with the technology, you put it together in a way that feels good and it will work.
