<li>There are only patterns, patterns on top of patterns, patterns that affect other patterns. Patterns hidden by patterns. Patterns within patterns. If you watch close, history does nothing but repeat itself. What we call chaos is just patterns we haven’t recognized. What we call random is just patterns we can’t decipher. What we can’t understand we call nonsense. What we can’t read we call gibberish. —CHUCK PALAHNIUK, SURVIVOR (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B08HLQW66B&amp;location=108">Location 108</a>)</li>
<li>My dataset showed that the founders of billion-dollar companies were more likely to have PhDs than be dropouts, many of them had entirely non-technical co-founders, fewer than 15 percent went through any accelerator program, many weren’t solving a personal problem, and very few were first to market.
