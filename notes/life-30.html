<li>the intelligence explosion argument made by the British mathematician Irving Good back in 1965: “Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.

<li>Technology is giving life the potential to flourish like never before—or to self-destruct. Future of Life Institute (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=433">Location 433</a>)

<li>Note: 看完 Goal 那一章之后我才意识到这句话的深意</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In other words, we can think of life as a self-replicating information-processing system whose information (software) determines both its behavior and the blueprints for its hardware. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=480">Location 480</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: 从此定义出发，我们也可以说我们宇宙自己也是生命。整个演化史是某种意义上的分形。</li>
</ul></li>
<li>“intelligent agents”: entities that collect information about their environment from sensors and then process this information to decide how to act back on their environment. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=488">Location 488</a>)</li>
<li>with. Your synapses store all your knowledge and skills as roughly 100 terabytes’ worth of information, while your DNA stores merely about a gigabyte, barely enough to store a single movie download. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=527">Location 527</a>)</li>
<li>The ability to design its software enables Life 2.0 to be not only smarter than Life 1.0, but also more flexible. If the environment changes, 1.0 can only adapt by slowly evolving over many generations. Life 2.0, on the other hand, can adapt almost instantly, via a software update. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=531">Location 531</a>)</li>
<li>Yet despite the most powerful technologies we have today, all life forms we know of remain fundamentally limited by their biological hardware. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=545">Location 545</a>)</li>
<li>All this requires life to undergo a final upgrade, to Life 3.0, which can design not only its software but also its hardware. In other words, Life 3.0 is the master of its own destiny, finally fully free from its evolutionary shackles.

<li>The gist of the letter was that the goal of AI should be redefined: the goal should be to create not undirected intelligence, but beneficial intelligence. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=664">Location 664</a>)</li>

<li>they all can be in many different long-lived states—long-lived enough to encode the information until it’s needed. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1005">Location 1005</a>)</li>
<li>information can take on a life of its own, independent of its physical substrate! (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1043">Location 1043</a>)</li>
<li>So far, the smallest memory device known to be evolved and used in the wild is the genome of the bacterium Candidatus Carsonella ruddii, storing about 40 kilobytes, whereas our human DNA stores about 1.6 gigabytes, comparable to a downloaded movie. As mentioned in the last chapter, our brains store much more information than our genes: in the ballpark of 10 gigabytes electrically (specifying which of your 100 billion neurons are firing at any one time) and 100 terabytes chemically/biologically (specifying how strongly different neurons are linked by synapses). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1070">Location 1070</a>)</li>
<li>Whereas you retrieve memories from a computer or hard drive by specifying where it’s stored, you retrieve memories from your brain by specifying something about what is stored. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1076">Location 1076</a>)</li>
<li>Such memory systems are called auto-associative, since they recall by association rather than by address. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1083">Location 1083</a>)</li>
<li>MIT researchers Norman Margolus and Tommaso Toffoli coined the name computronium for any substance that can perform arbitrary computations. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1149">Location 1149</a>)</li>
<li>This fact that exactly the same computation can be performed on any universal computer means that computation is substrate-independent in the same way that information is: it can take on a life of its own, independent of its physical substrate!

<li>In short, computation is a pattern in the spacetime arrangement of particles, and it’s not the particles but the pattern that really matters! Matter doesn’t matter. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1198">Location 1198</a>)</li>
<li>The ability to learn is arguably the most fascinating aspect of general intelligence. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1269">Location 1269</a>)</li>
<li>the simple task of multiplying n numbers requires a whopping 2n neurons for a network with only one layer, but takes only about 4n neurons in a deep network. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1367">Location 1367</a>)
<ul>
<li>Note: 太神奇了深层神经网络可以用更少的神经元完成更多的任务</li>

<li>After all, matter can be arranged so that when it obeys the laws of physics, it remembers, computes and learns—and the matter doesn’t need to be biological. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1436">Location 1436</a>)</li>
<li>two popular choices of this activation function are the so-called sigmoid function σ(x) ≡ 1/(1 + e−x) and the ramp function σ(x) = max{0, x}, although it’s been proven that almost any function will suffice as long as it’s not linear (a straight line). (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1481">Location 1481</a>)</li>
<li>the true importance of DeepMind’s breakthrough is that deep reinforcement learning is a completely general technique. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1547">Location 1547</a>)</li>
<li>I confessed above that I view intuition and creativity as two of my core human traits, and as I’ll now explain, I feel that AlphaGo displayed both. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1574">Location 1574</a>)</li>

<li>as we put AI in charge of ever more physical systems, we need to put serious research efforts into not only making the machines work well on their own, but also into making machines collaborate effectively with their human controllers. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1818">Location 1818</a>)</li>
<li>fourth challenge: they need to improve not only verification, validation and control, but also security against malicious software (“malware”) and hacks. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1854">Location 1854</a>)</li>
<li>what if this system finds that recidivism is statistically linked to a prisoner’s sex or race—would this count as a sexist, racist robojudge that needs reprogramming? (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=1919">Location 1919</a>)

<li>Second, they claim that since the year 2000, an ever-larger share of corporate income has gone to those who own the companies as opposed to those who work there—and that as long as automation continues, we should expect those who own the machines to take a growing fraction of the pie.

<li>If a machine can think, it might think more intelligently than we do, and then where should we be?

<li>Digesting a candy bar is merely 0.00000001% efficient, in the sense that it releases a mere ten-trillionth of the energy mc2 that it contains. If your stomach were even 0.001% efficient, then you’d only need to eat a single meal for the rest of your life. Compared to eating, the burning of coal and gasoline are merely 3 and 5 times more efficient, respectively. Today’s nuclear reactors do dramatically better by splitting uranium atoms through fission, but still fail to extract more than 0.08% of their energy. The nuclear reactor in the core of the Sun is an order of magnitude more efficient than those we’ve built, extracting 0.7% of the energy from hydrogen by fusing it into helium.

<li>Remarkably, physicists have since discovered that all laws of classical physics can be mathematically reformulated in an analogous way: out of all ways that nature could choose to do something, it prefers the optimal way, which typically boils down to minimizing or maximizing some quantity. There are two mathematically equivalent ways of describing each physical law: either as the past causing the future, or as nature optimizing something.

<li>Utilitarianism: Positive conscious experiences should be maximized and suffering should be minimized. • Diversity: A diverse set of positive experiences is better than many repetitions of the same experience, even if the latter has been identified as the most positive experience possible. • Autonomy: Conscious entities/societies should have the freedom to pursue their own goals unless this conflicts with an overriding principle. • Legacy: Compatibility with scenarios that most humans today would view as happy, incompatibility with scenarios that essentially all humans today would view as terrible.

Humans pursuing not replication but goals related to pleasure, curiosity, compassion and other feelings that they’d evolved to help them replicate 4.

<li>So entropy is hardly something we would want our AI to call “goodness” and strive to maximize. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=4902">Location 4902</a>)</li>
<li>Life is a phenomenon that can help dissipate (increase overall messiness) even faster by retaining or growing its complexity and replicating while increasing the messiness of its environment. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=4930">Location 4930</a>)</li>
<li>The influential Austro-British philosopher Karl Popper popularized the now widely accepted adage “If it’s not falsifiable, it’s not scientific.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5053">Location 5053</a>)</li>
<li>They’re known as behavioral correlates of consciousness, and they’re closely linked to the effortful, slow and controlled way of thinking that psychologists call “System 2.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5126">Location 5126</a>)</li>
<li>How can something as complex as consciousness be made of something as simple as particles? I think it’s because it’s a phenomenon that has properties above and beyond those of its particles. In physics, we call such phenomena “emergent.” (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5277">Location 5277</a>)</li>
<li>If consciousness is the way that information feels when it’s processed in certain ways, then it must be substrate-independent; it’s only the structure of the information processing that matters, not the structure of the matter doing the information processing. In other words, consciousness is substrate-independent twice over! (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5350">Location 5350</a>)</li>
<li>If the information processing itself obeys certain principles, it can give rise to the higher-level emergent phenomenon that we call consciousness. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5356">Location 5356</a>)</li>
<li>what feels like goal-oriented behavior can emerge from goal-less deterministic laws of physics. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5500">Location 5500</a>)

<li>Moreover, as emphasized by Seth Lloyd,34 there’s a famous computer-science theorem saying that for almost all computations, there’s no faster way of determining their outcome than actually running them. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5502">Location 5502</a>)</li>
<li>It’s not our Universe giving meaning to conscious beings, but conscious beings giving meaning to our Universe. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5522">Location 5522</a>)</li>
<li>So the very first goal on our wish list for the future should be retaining (and hopefully expanding) biological and/or artificial consciousness in our cosmos, rather than driving it extinct.

<li>The rise of AI will force us to abandon this and become more humble. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5531">Location 5531</a>)</li>
<li>Philosophers like to go Latin on this distinction, by contrasting sapience (the ability to think intelligently) with sentience (the ability to subjectively experience qualia). We humans have built our identity on being Homo sapiens, the smartest entities around. As we prepare to be humbled by ever smarter machines, I suggest that we rebrand ourselves as Homo sentiens!

<li>The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. Isaac Asimov (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5603">Location 5603</a>)</li>

<li>I made a New Year’s resolution for 2014 that I was no longer allowed to complain about anything without putting some serious thought into what I could personally do about it, (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B06WGNPM7V&amp;location=5617">Location 5617</a>)

<li>Erik pointed out that according to game theory, positive visions form the foundation of a large fraction of all collaboration in the world, from marriages and corporate mergers to the decision of independent states to form the USA.

<li>this is why I’ve encouraged you throughout this book to think about what sort of future you want rather than merely what sort of future you fear, so that we can find shared goals to plan and work for.
