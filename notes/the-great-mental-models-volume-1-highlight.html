<ul>
<li>Charlie Munger, Nassim Taleb, Charles Darwin, Peter Kaufman, Peter Bevelin, Richard Feynman, Albert Einstein, (Location 84)</li>
<li>In life and business, the person with the fewest blind spots wins. Removing blind spots means we see, interact with, and move closer to understanding reality. We think better. And thinking better is about finding simple processes that help us work through problems from multiple dimensions and perspectives, allowing us to better choose solutions that fit what matters to us. The skill for finding the right solutions for the right problems is one form of wisdom. (Location 99)</li>
<li>thinking better isn’t about being a genius. It is about the processes we use to uncover reality and the choices we make once we do. (Location 111)</li>
<li>A mental model is simply a representation of how something works. We cannot keep all of the details of the world in our brains, so we use models to simplify the complex into understandable and organizable chunks. (Location 116)</li>
<li>Mistakes can become catastrophes whose effects keep compounding, creating stress and limiting our choices. (Location 131)</li>
<li>When understanding is separated from reality, we lose our powers. Understanding must constantly be tested against reality and updated accordingly. (Location 155)</li>
<li>Our failures to update from interacting with reality spring primarily from three things: not having the right perspective or vantage point, ego-induced denial, and distance from the consequences of our decisions. (Location 166)</li>
<li>The first flaw is perspective. We have a hard time seeing any system that we are in. (Location 169)</li>
<li>The second flaw is ego. Many of us tend to have too much invested in our opinions of ourselves to see the world’s feedback—the feedback we need to update our beliefs about reality. (Location 179)</li>
<li>First, we’re so afraid about what others will say about us that we fail to put our ideas out there and subject them to criticism. This way we can always be right. Second, if we do put our ideas out there and they are criticized, our ego steps in to protect us. We become invested in defending instead of upgrading our ideas. (Location 181)</li>
<li>The third flaw is distance. The further we are from the results of our decisions, the easier it is to keep our current views rather than update them. (Location 184)</li>
<li>It’s easier to fool ourselves that we’re right at a high level than at the micro level, because at the micro level we see and feel the immediate consequences. (Location 192)</li>
<li>As Confucius said, “A man who has committed a mistake and doesn’t correct it, is committing another mistake.” (Location 195)</li>
<li>We also tend to undervalue the elementary ideas and overvalue the complicated ones. (Location 199)</li>
<li>« Most geniuses—especially those who lead others—prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities. »<br />
Andy Benoit (Location 208)</li>
<li>Understanding only becomes useful when we adjust our behavior and actions accordingly. (Location 215)</li>
<li>We are passive, thinking these things just happened to us and not that we did something to cause them. (Location 227)</li>
<li>We optimize for short-term ego protection over long-term happiness. (Location 236)</li>
<li>Sometimes making good decisions boils down to avoiding bad ones. (Location 264)</li>
<li>« The chief enemy of good decisions is a lack of sufficient perspectives on a problem. »<br />
Alain de Botton (Location 320)</li>
<li>To quote Charlie Munger, “80 or 90 important models will carry about 90 percent of the freight in making you a worldly-wise person. And, of those, only a mere handful really carry very heavy freight.” (Location 332)</li>
<li>All are models or maps that simplify some complex territory in order to guide you through it. (Location 399)</li>
<li>the map is not the territory. In other words, the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not reality. The abstraction is not the abstracted. (Location 404)</li>
<li>Maps describe a territory in a useful way, but with a specific purpose. They cannot be everything to everyone. (Location 408)</li>
<li>The truth is, the only way we can navigate the complexity of reality is through some sort of abstraction. (Location 416)</li>
<li>We can’t use maps as dogma. (Location 428)</li>
<li>This is a double problem. First, having a general map, we may assume that if a territory matches the map in a couple of respects it matches the map in all respects. Second, we may think adherence to the map is more important than taking in new information about a territory. (Location 470)</li>
<li>They are guidebooks, not laws. (Location 473)</li>
<li>«Remember that all models are wrong; the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful.»<br />
George Box (Location 474)</li>
<li>with which to explore the history of the territory of Palestine. (Location 492)</li>
<li>Countries come and go depending on shifting political and cultural sensibilities. When we look at the world map we have today, we tend to associate societies with nations, assuming that the borders reflect a common identity shared by everyone contained within them. (Location 499)</li>
<li>as historian Margaret MacMillan has pointed out, nationalism is a very modern construct, and in some sense has developed with, not in advance of, the maps that set out the shape of countries. (Location 501)</li>
<li>The Death and Life of Great American Cities. (Location 512)</li>
<li>There is no shortcut to understanding. Building a circle of competence takes years of experience, of making mistakes, and of actively seeking out better methods of practice and thought. (Location 616)</li>
<li>There are three key practices needed in order to build and maintain a circle of competence: curiosity and a desire to learn, monitoring, and feedback. (Location 620)</li>
<li>There are three parts to successfully operating outside a circle of competence: (Location 655)</li>
<li>«Ignorance more often begets confidence than knowledge.»<br />
Charles Darwin (Location 703)</li>
<li>Karl Popper wrote “A theory is part of empirical science if and only if it conflicts with possible experiences13 and is therefore in principle falsifiable by experience.” (Location 720)</li>
<li>We tend to assume that the worst that has happened is the worst that can happen, and then prepare for that. We forget that “the worst” smashed a previous understanding of what was the worst. (Location 754)</li>
<li>Applying the filter of falsifiability helps us sort through which theories are more robust. If they can’t ever be proven false because we have no way of testing them, then the best we can do is try to determine their probability of being true. (Location 756)</li>
<li>I don’t know what’s the matter with people: they don’t learn by understanding; they learn by some other way—by rote or something. Their knowledge is so fragile!<br />
Richard Feynman (Location 760)
<ul>
<li>Note: 跟苏格拉底说的一无所知好像有点关系</li>
</ul></li>
<li>knowledge can only be built when we are actively trying to falsify it (Location 778)</li>
<li>our knowledge of first principles changes as we understand more. (Location 780)</li>
<li>When it comes down to it, everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief. Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoin. So is love. The list goes on. (Location 790)</li>
<li>If we want to identify the principles in a situation to cut through the dogma and the shared belief, there are two techniques we can use: Socratic questioning and the Five Whys. (Location 791)</li>
<li>How do I know I am correct?) (Location 799)
<ul>
<li>Note: Ray Dalio</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Socratic questioning stops you from relying on your gut and limits strong emotional responses. This process helps you build something that lasts. (Location 802)</li>
<li>If your “whys” result in a statement of falsifiable fact, you have hit a first principle. If they end up with a “because I said so” or ”it just is”, you know you have landed on an assumption that may be based on popular opinion, cultural myth, or dogma. These are not first principles. (Location 808)</li>
<li>First principles thinking helps us avoid the problem of relying on someone else’s tactics without understanding the rationale behind them. (Location 840)</li>
<li>So when we start with the idea that the way things are might not be the way they have to be, we put ourselves in the right frame of mind to identify first principles. (Location 856)</li>
<li>The real power of first principles thinking is moving away from random change and into choices that have a real possibility of success. (Location 857)</li>
<li>Thinking through first principles is a way of taking off the blinders. Most things suddenly seem more possible. (Location 882)</li>
<li>“Law of Unintended Consequences” (Location 1067)
<ul>
<li>Note: 如 物质奖励的毒性后果</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You can never delete consequences to arrive at the original starting conditions. (Location 1076)</li>
<li>He developed second-order thinking into a tool, showing that if you don’t consider “the effects of the effects,” you can’t really claim to be doing any thinking at all. (Location 1083)</li>
<li>High degrees of connections make second-order thinking all the more critical, because denser webs of relationships make it easier for actions to have far-reaching consequences. (Location 1089)</li>
<li>Second-Order Problem (Location 1101)</li>
<li>How often is short-term gain worth protracted long-term pain? (Location 1104)</li>
<li>Once a few people decide to stand on their tip-toes, everyone has to stand on their tip-toes. No one can see any better, but they’re all worse off. (Location 1106)</li>
<li>Prioritizing long-term interests over immediate gains Constructing effective arguments (Location 1111)</li>
<li>“What Auletes passed down to his daughter was a precarious (Location 1131)</li>
<li>Developing Trust for Future Success (Location 1140)</li>
<li>Arguments are more effective when we demonstrate that we have considered the second-order effects and put effort into verifying that these are desirable as well. (Location 1156)</li>
<li>How you’ll balance the need for higher-order thinking with practical, limiting judgment must be taken on a case-by-case basis. (Location 1181)</li>
