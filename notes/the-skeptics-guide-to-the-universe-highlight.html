<ul>
<li>the lack of any relationship between confidence in a memory and its accuracy. We tend to think that vividness and confidence predict accuracy, but they don’t. (Location 433)</li>
<li>What we think we see is not objective; it is a process of our brains, and that process can be fooled. (Location 485)</li>
<li>The bottom line is this: Your real-time perceptions are not a passive recording of the outside world. (Location 487)</li>
<li>If so, then it must have agency. (Location 509)

<li>It might seem like these sensations are inevitable consequences of the obvious fact that you are your body. This isn’t true, however. All of those bodily sensations are active constructions by the brain, requiring specific circuits dedicated to that purpose. (Location 528)</li>
<li>The lesson here is that even the most basic components of your existence are actively constructed by your brain. Each component can be disrupted and erased. (Location 544)</li>
<li>There is a related phenomenon called change blindness, which reflects our inability to notice changes in detail. (Location 577)</li>
<li>The psychologist Justin Barrett coined the term “hyperactive (or hypersensitive) agency detection device”—HADD—to describe this tendency (Location 693)</li>
<li>being “alive” (from a psychological point of view) is not about biology, it’s about agency—something that can act in the world, that has its own will and can cause things to happen. (Location 696)</li>
<li>As previously discussed, even our visual system separates the world into things with agency and things without (Location 698)

</ul></li>
<li>on a fundamental level, our brains treat agents differently than objects—from the very moment we see them. (Location 699)</li>
<li>According to Barrett, HADD works in part by detecting any movement that is non-inertial—something that seems to be moving of its own volition. (Location 705)</li>
<li>HADD detects more than movement: (Location 709)</li>
<li>Studies have demonstrated that HADD is more likely to be triggered when a stimulus is ambiguous. (Location 714)</li>
<li>our HADD becomes more active in situations where we have less control (which contributes to superstitious beliefs). (Location 715)</li>
<li>The apparent reason for sleep paralysis is our safety. (Location 747)</li>
<li>They concluded that approximately 8 percent of people experience sleep paralysis, rising to around 28 percent in high-risk groups (those who have a poor or disrupted sleep pattern, such as students) and up to 35 percent in those suffering from psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. (Location 753)</li>
<li>The biggest problems come from assuming that the phenomenon is a reflection of external reality rather than an internal experience happening in the brain. (Location 758)</li>
<li>The real lesson from our knowledge of hypnagogia is that we can’t assume our brains are always functioning flawlessly and therefore whatever we think we experienced must be real (Location 774)</li>
