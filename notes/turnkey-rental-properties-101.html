<h2 id="highlights">Highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>Higher-risk markets are likely to have a historically declining population trend, have more unsafe neighborhoods, contain older properties, and/or generally have a lower-quality population. These markets are likely to advertise higher returns than higher quality markets which is often what appeals to investors.

<li>Lower-risk markets tend to be strong, growing markets with a lot of solid industry and an increasing population trend. The trade-off is you may have to pay more for properties and earn a lower cash flow every month, but your risk will be less.

<li>talk to the turnkey provider and ask him how the appraisals have been coming in recently. (<a href="https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;asin=B0791MMHDN&amp;location=387">Location 387</a>)</li>
